<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>These talks were given in the autumn of 1894
as a course on Advanced English Composition in
the Lowell Free Classes, and that they are now
printed is largely due to the fact that they were
so well received by those who then heard them.
In preparing them, I consulted whatever books
upon composition came to my hand. I examined
some with profit, some with pleasure, and
some, it must be confessed, not wholly without
amusement, or even impatience. Doubtless, I owe
something to many of these books; but I am not
conscious of much obligation to any save the
&ldquo;Principles of Rhetoric,&rdquo; by Professor A. S.
Hill, &ldquo;English Composition,&rdquo; by Professor Barrett
Wendell, and &ldquo;English Prose,&rdquo; by Professor
John Earle.</p>

<p>I have conscientiously endeavored to make the
lectures as practical as possible, stating as clearly
as I could those things which would have been
most helpful to me had I read and heeded them
twenty years ago. The necessity of holding an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span>audience made fitting some effort to render the
talks entertaining; but I have never consciously
said anything for the mere purpose of being amusing,
and I have never been of the opinion that a
book gains either in dignity or in usefulness by
being dull. My purpose has throughout been sincerely
serious, and if the book shall prove helpful,
I shall have attained the object for which it was
written.</p>

THE ART OF WRITING
</p>

<p>Into all productive art enter two sorts of power,
that which is communicable and that which is incommunicable,&mdash;in
other words, that which may
be taught and that which is inborn. Upon this
fact is based the distinction between the mechanical
and the fine arts, although since both kinds
of power have a share in all production nobody has
ever been able to draw a sharp and definite line at
which the mechanical arts end and the fine arts begin.
The power which is incommunicable is that
of imagination, that indefinable grace and skill, that
enchantment of creative ability which is born with
rare individuals, and for which he who is not dowered
with it by nature struggles in vain. It is this
which has given rise to that saying as profound as
it is terribly hackneyed which declares that a poet
is born and not made. It is this which distinguishes
genius from talent; and it is this which has
so dazzled the eyes of the world as to produce the
mistaken notion that since imagination is not to be
learned nothing is to be learned in the realm of art.</p>

<p>This incommunicable power is the soul of fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>art; yet into fine art no less than into the mechanical
arts comes also that power which may be
learned. This communicable power is commonly
spoken of as the technical, or as technique. This
any person of intelligence and perseverance can
and may master if he choose, every man according
to his ability; and this every artist must acquire,
no matter how richly he may have been gifted by
nature with the magic power which transcends and
dominates it. It is this that musicians, painters,
sculptors, architects, dancers, and writers are set
to learn when they are said to study art. The
world has long recognized that in painting, music,
sculpture, and architecture it is indispensable that
technique shall be acquired; but&mdash;absurd as it
may seem&mdash;it is only recently, comparatively
speaking, that it has been practically recognized
that this is as true of poetry as of painting, as true
of literature as of any other art. It is in truth
only in our own day that there has been anything
like a general acceptance of the fact that in literature
as in the other arts technical skill must be
laboriously acquired before any successful and permanent
work can be produced. The masters have
of course known this; but the idea that to be an
author nothing is needed but pen, ink, and paper
used to hold undisputed sway over the popular
mind, and is by no means extinct yet. Not long
ago I heard a learned professor in one of the leading
American colleges declare that he could not see
what there is to learn in composition. Last summer
a gentleman of really wide reading, but who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>was brought up under the old system, said to me:
&ldquo;By teaching composition, I suppose you mean
chiefly correcting the grammar and punctuation.&rdquo;
He was somewhat surprised when I explained that
students were supposed to have mastered both
grammar and punctuation before the teaching of
composition as such could begin.</p>

<p>The truth is that there has never been anything
like a popular understanding of the difference between
spoken and written speech. Anybody is supposed
to be able to talk, and to learn to do so unconsciously,&mdash;a
doctrine to which I do not wish to be
understood as giving assent!&mdash;and it has been
held to follow that anybody could write. To write
was merely to talk with the pen, and that has commonly
been held to be all there is to the matter
save for the fact that some persons were born to
write and some were not.</p>

<p>A personal experience of my own illustrates this,
if its introduction may be pardoned. I have never
forgotten the general bewilderment with which my
friends met my announcement when I left college
that I meant to study literature. That one should
follow literature as a profession was not entirely
unintelligible, if it did suggest a dire mental
weakness on the part of the young man who was
rash enough to take such a resolution; but how
one studied literature as a profession was beyond
ordinary understanding. &ldquo;You mean that you are
going to write books,&rdquo; some said tentatively. My
reply that such a possibility was presupposed in
the study of literature just as the pleading of cases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>might be presupposed in the study of law only increased
the difficulty of the confusing puzzle. It
was of course understood that there was in the law
something to study; but what, in the name of common
sense, was there to study in literature? Books
one sat down and wrote, and that was the whole
of it; and I soon found the idea gaining ground
that I only put the matter in this way for the sake
of producing an impression, or perhaps of covering
a fixed and reprehensible intention of doing
nothing.</p>

<p>I thought then that I had some idea of what the
study of literature really meant, and I gave such
explanations as I could; but, alas, the incessant
work of years has chiefly served to show me how
inadequate my idea was, and how much more there
is to be learned than I then had any notion of!
Some of the things which experience has taught
me I think may be of value to you; and in these
lectures I shall try to state them, although I realize
but too well how far I am from being able to
cover or exhaust the subject. I shall, of course,
say some things which all of you know already,
and many things which some of you know. I hope,
however, to say also some things which you have not
thought of, and by arrangement and system to give
fresh value and force to old ideas. It is not impossible
that experience has shown me things which
will be practically helpful to others. Any man
who has wrought long at a craft is likely to be able
to give suggestions valuable to those who have not.
The sluggard is by the Scriptures referred to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>ant not on account of her intellectual superiority,
but solely because of her great practical training.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>All discussion must begin with definition, either
expressed or understood. There is of course no
doubt that each of us has an idea what composition
is, yet to be sure that we are agreed, it is necessary
to state the meaning in which we use the term.
Let us say, then:&mdash;</p>

<p>Composition is the art by which ideas and mental
impressions are conveyed in written language.</p>

<p>Nothing could sound more simple; few things
are more difficult of achievement. It is not hard to
convey ideas, but it is by no means easy to be sure
that they will arrive at their destination in good
order. Impressions and ideas are delicate things,
and are most liable to be injured in the passage.
There are writers whose methods suggest an attempt
to get eggs to market by shooting them from
a cannon,&mdash;the eggs may arrive, it is true, but
in what condition? The means must be adapted
to that with which one is dealing. It is folly to
attempt to carry soap-bubbles in a mealsack or
leaden bullets in a lace handkerchief. The student
of the art of writing has to learn to suit his
means to the end sought. He must train himself
to judge what manner of expression, of style, or
treatment, will best serve to transfer ideas from
his own mind to that of the reader. He must
study the effect of words and of combinations of
words; the value of suggestion, and of all the emotional
effects possible in written words. He must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>train himself to be able to use language as a
skillful swordsman uses his rapier, adapting it to
every emergency, master of it always; he must learn
to be dexterous, adroit, and full of resources.</p>

<p>Exactly to impart an idea or an impression to
another human being is manifestly impossible.
The character of the mind of the receiver necessarily
affects and modifies whatever comes to it. The
thing which we say to our closest friend strikes
him in a way somehow and somewhat different from
that which we intend. A poem by John Boyle
O&rsquo;Reilly expresses this so fully that I take leave
to quote it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ic">AT BEST.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The faithful helm commands the keel,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From port to port fair breezes blow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the ship must sail the convex sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor may she straighter go.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, man to man; in fair accord,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On thought and will, the winds may wait;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the world will bend the passing word,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though its shortest course be straight.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From soul to soul the shortest line<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At best will bended be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ship that holds the straightest course<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still sails the convex sea.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I do not quote this merely as a matter of sentiment,
but because it phrases one of the most
insistent and practical difficulties with which every
writer must contend. The study of literary art,
and indeed of all art, is in one sense an effort at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>approximation. Perfect expression can never be
reached, and the thing after which a writer strives
is to approach more and more closely toward that
complete transmission of meaning which is forever
unattainable while the barriers of human individuality
stand between mind and mind.</p>

<p>We recognize this fact as soon as we reflect.
Bob, thinking of Betty, remarks to Jack that he
does admire a pretty girl; and Jack, fondly recalling
the features of Jane, receives the idea with all
the variations which belong to an altogether different
idea of feminine loveliness. Tom, Dick, and
Harry, returning from the races, declare to one another
that it has been a jolly day. Each accepts
the statements of his companions according to his
individual experiences, and no one has imparted
precisely the thought which was in his own mind.
We praise a picture, a piece of music, a sunset, and
the friend to whom we speak listens with a temperament
and cultivation so different from our own
that our words inevitably mean one thing to us and
another to him. The ear which hears has always
its share in the impression produced as surely as
has the tongue that speaks.</p>

<p>The result might be much the same whether the
words in these cases were spoken or written; but
there is another element which makes an immense
difference between oral and written communication.
The speaker adds to his words a language of emphasis,
of inflection, of facial expression, of gesture,
of mien. He modifies what he says by what he
looks; his bearing has as important a share in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>work of conveying impressions as have his words.
Two actors taking the same text will give characters
so different as hardly to seem to have anything
in common. A speaker may so contradict and
override his speech that his hearer believes not the
tongue that speaks, but the personality and manner
which declare the contrary. You remember how
Emerson puts this: &ldquo;What you are stands over
you the while, and thunders so that I cannot hear
what you say to the contrary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now the writer is confronted by the necessity of
making himself intelligible without the many aids
by which the speaker may help out or modify his
oral communication. The novelist, it is true, may
avail himself of the simple device of describing the
manner in which his characters speak. He tells us
that this was said with a sly look of coquetry, while
that was uttered in a voice of utter misery, and the
other thundered forth in tones of overmastering
determination. My washing came home in London
last summer wrapped in a newspaper containing
an installment of a blood-curdling tale which
began thus: &ldquo;Eleanore shot at Reginald from under
her pellucid brows a lingering look of lurid hate.&rdquo;
All this, however, is at its best ineffective and
unsatisfactory, even when heroines have pellucid
brows and the author is master of the art of alliteration.
Some things are within the province of
language and some are not.</p>

<p>Words may describe form, color, sound, and motion,
but they can reproduce none of them. What
they can do is to call up in the mind of the reader
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>something which he has seen; or aid him to construct
from material in his memory some new image.
If one read a description of a landscape, for
instance, he unconsciously selects bits of nature
which he remembers and arranges them as nearly
as may be after the pattern which the author gives.
On the first page of &ldquo;Westward Ho!&rdquo; there is a
description of&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">the little white town of Bideford, which slopes upward
from its broad tide-river paved with yellow sands, and
many-arched old bridge where salmon wait for autumn
floods, toward the pleasant upland on the west. Above
the town hills close in, cushioned with deep oak woods,
through which juts here and there a crag of fern-fringed
slate; below they lower, and open more and more in
softly-rounded knolls, and fertile squares of red and
green, till they sink into the wide expanse of hazy
flats, rich salt marshes and rolling sand-hills, where
Torridge joins her sister Tor, and both together flow
quietly toward the broad surges of the bar, and the
everlasting thunder of the long Atlantic swell.</p></div>

<p>The reader constructs the picture as he goes on;
but unless he has actually seen &ldquo;the little white
town of Bideford&rdquo; the picture in his mind is likely
to bear no very close resemblance to the reality.
The broad tide-river which his fancy sees is some
stream of his boyhood&rsquo;s home, and far enough from
North Devon; the many-arched old bridge may be
one which he knows or which comes to his memory
from a picture,&mdash;perhaps from a photograph that
a friend has brought from abroad of some hoary
stone structure spanning a French river or a stream
of Italy. The hills and the fern-clad cliffs are recalled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>in the same way, their outlines identical with
the curves of some spot in the Catskills, in Wales,
in Brittany, or wherever the reader is most familiar
or has been most impressed. It is evident
that the most carefully elaborate verbal description
could not enable the artist to reproduce a scene;
and herein is manifest the limitation of words in
this direction.</p>

<p>The inadequacy of words becomes the more evident
when it comes to matters intellectual. Who
has not, even in conversation, experienced that baffled
and hopeless feeling which comes from not
being able to make another understand? Who
does not know the sensation of being shut in as by
walls of stone, so that it is impossible to reach the
comprehension of the one addressed? Yet the
speaker has a hundred advantages over the writer.
He has at command all the resources of gesture,
of look, accent, tone, mien. No man has written
much and written earnestly without experiencing
moments of complete despair in regard to being
able to convey to his readers that which it is in his
heart to say.</p>

<p>How far it is possible to overcome the obstacles
which hinder communication is the study of
the literary&mdash;as of every&mdash;artist. We human
beings are prisoned in the solitary confinement of
the body, and must needs devise means of sharing
our thoughts, as political convicts in the Russian
prisons strive to communicate by rapping on the
walls. Every device by which intelligence may be
carried more safely and surely is an addition to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>intellectual resources and strength of the race. On
this power of mutual transference and understanding
of thought depends the whole intellectual progress
of men, and on individual mastery of it rests
the ability to share that progress.</p>

<p>It is only by the most careful and patient labor,
the most rigid self-discipline, that advance can be
made in a matter so difficult and so delicate. If
you have supposed that the art of composition is
one easily acquired, I beg you to lay aside that idea
at the start. It is true that any person who has
had an ordinary school training may write a poor
letter or a badly bungled paragraph. Some even
attain to a respectable facility in the superficial
expression of ordinary ideas. To go beyond this,
however, to arrive at being able really to write,
to be capable of expressing with the pen genuine
thoughts and real emotions with a reasonable hope
that these will reach the reader not entirely distorted
out of all resemblance to what they were
when they left the mind of the writer,&mdash;this requires
labor long and strenuous. The devils of
incoherence, obscurity, and incompetency go not out
save by untiring striving and watching.</p>

<p>This is strikingly illustrated by the great gulf
between amateur and professional work. Many
newspaper reporters are ignorant and intellectually
untrained; yet merely from continuous and earnest
practice they become so dexterous in the use of
words as to be able to serve their needs with surprising
facility. I have had well educated and
cultivated men come into my office when I was an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>editor, and spend an hour in trying satisfactorily
to phrase some simple announcement which they
wished printed. All that there was to do was to
say that such a charity needed funds, that a subscription
had been opened, or some learned society
was to meet at such a time and place; yet the amateur
would struggle with the paragraph in an agony
of ineptitude which was alike pathetic and farcical.
When at last the conflict between mind and matter
ended from the sheer exhaustion of the mind, there
would be handed to me a scrawled sheet, recrossed
and rewritten, and in the end a miracle of obscurity
and awkwardness,&mdash;the art of how not to say it
illustrated to perfection. Then after the visitor had
taken himself off, in a condition not far from nervous
exhaustion, it was only necessary to say to a
reporter: &ldquo;Make a paragraph of these facts.&rdquo; In
a couple of minutes the slip would be ready to send
to the printer, written in English not elegant, but
easy and above all clear. The reporter had very
likely not a hundredth part of the information or
the experience of life of the amateur, but he had
had continued business-like drill. He had written
as a matter of steady work, with the improving
consciousness of an editorial blue pencil ever before
his mind. I have seen many definitions of the
difference between amateur and professional work.
To my own mind it has always seemed sufficient to
say that the professional is one who has learned
how to do a thing while the amateur is one who has
not.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the difficulty of saying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>a thing is the difficulty of knowing when it is said.
Anybody may write, but only the trained writer is
able to be sure that what he has written says what
he supposes it to say. This is of course doubly
true from the need that there is of making words
impart mood as well as meaning, the atmosphere
as well as the facts. If it is hard to express
ideas, it is doubly hard to embody also the state
of mind from which they spring and which must
be understood before their real value and significance
can be appreciated. Not only is it far
from easy to know when the written word will express
what is meant; it is no less hard to be sure
how much of a thought is actually on paper. It
requires great effort to realize that the sentence or
the paragraph which we write will not mean to the
reader all that we wish him to understand. The
thought in our mind is so vivid, so poignant, so
vital, that for us the words brim over with significance
as a full honeycomb drips with honey. The
emotion which we feel in writing seems to belong
inevitably to what is written, and to be inseparable
from it. It is of all things most difficult for the
author, especially in an impassioned mood, to put
himself in the place of the cool and unmoved public;
yet in no other way is it possible to judge
how that public will be affected; in no other way
is it possible to compare what is written with what
is intended; to estimate the power of those poor
black conventional signs there on the paper to express
the thought and the mood, the glow and the
fervor of head and of heart which it is their mission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>to carry vibrating and alive to the mind and the
spirit of the reader.</p>

<p>It has often been remarked that authors are apt
to be most fond of works which are not their best,
and it is notorious that the most passionately poetic
mood may be that in which a writer produces his
least effective compositions. It is easy to see how
this is connected with the point under consideration.
In the aroused, imaginative, ecstatic mood
every word is suggestive, every phrase full of meaning,
each sentence rich with emotion. The writer
who is carried away by his feelings is apt to go
beyond the range of his judgment. He puts down
the sign of his mood in language intelligible only
to himself. He writes a sort of emotional shorthand,
illegible to every eye except his own. To
him it may remain beautiful because to him it recalls
the exalted mood which produced it. To him
it is the significant and sufficient memorandum of
a thing beautiful and sublime; to others it is but
a mass of words left by the elusive</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fancies which broke through language and escaped.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Dr. Holmes has said, with that quaint mingling
of wit and wisdom which made him unique, that
writing a poem is like pouring syrup out of a
pitcher,&mdash;some of it always sticks to the pitcher.
The principle holds good of all composition, and by
no means the smallest thing to be learned is to
judge how completely the syrup has been poured
out. Often it is necessary to let the mood pass
away entirely before one can estimate work. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>frequently well to let a manuscript lie by until
the original enthusiasm of creation has faded fully,
whether this process requires more or less time than
the nine years which Horace recommended as the
proper period during which a poem should remain
unpublished.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not necessary to speak much of the
value of a mastery of the art of composition; but
there is one point which needs to be touched upon.
There is a prevalent if not generally spoken idea
that while this skill is an excellent thing, it is
really necessary to nobody save professional writers;
that while persons who give their lives to writing
must of course master technique, it is not at
all worth while for others to bother about a thing
so difficult. That this error is less wide-spread
than of old is evident from the increased attention
which is everywhere given to composition in all
modern schemes of education; but it survives in
popular misapprehension. The truth is, on the
contrary, that as society is organized to-day it is
essential that every man or woman who hopes to
make his or her way, at least to anything like eminence
even comparative, shall be able to write
fairly good English. In a world so largely dominated
by the printing-press as is ours in these modern
days, not only has the man who can express
himself in ink a manifest advantage, but he who
cannot is hampered from the start. The highest
skill in composition which can be acquired is of
instant practical value in every profession. Students
of technical and scientific subjects seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>me to be as truly acquiring practical training when
they are improving their skill in writing as when
they are performing experiments in the laboratory
or smelting ores at the furnaces. In reports to
corporations, papers on sanitary engineering addressed
to city officials, schemes for railroads or
telegraphs laid before legislative committees, they
will have need of all the literary cleverness that
they can compass, all the literary skill which they
are able to acquire. Competition is fierce all along
the line, and facility in the use of the pen counts in
every trade and in every profession no less truly
than it does among avowed writers.</p>

<p>Nor is this the whole of the matter. Into every-day,
common experience has the modern habit of
life brought the need of being master of expression;
and even he who does not put pen to paper&mdash;if
it is possible to suppose such a person to exist
among intelligent people&mdash;is under the necessity
of cultivating his knowledge of the art of expression
to the end that he may read more intelligently
and more sensitively. There is great need of establishing
communication with our fellow-men;
there is hardly less need of learning to establish
communication with ourselves. It seems sometimes
as if our beings were like those Chinese carved
balls which Tennyson calls</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Laborious orient ivory sphere in sphere.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">We strive to make our different selves know one
another, but we find it hard. We are conscious of
feelings, of ideas, of emotions, which some sphere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of our manifold being knows, yet which to us&mdash;to
the outer sphere, to the external Ego, so to say&mdash;are
vague and distant however keenly we long to
understand. The ability to phrase for others is
soon found to be ability to phrase for ourselves.
By no means the least of the advantages, as it is
one of the greatest of the delights, of conquering
expression, is the power of interpreting ourselves to
ourselves.</p>

<p>There is a crude popular idea that the refinements
of literary art are wasted, at any rate upon
the general reader. So many books succeed, at
least temporarily, which can make no slightest
pretense to any grace of manner, and which have
not even the merit of reasonable accuracy, that the
student is apt to feel that these things are superfluous.</p>

<p>Of course the ordinary reader does not perceive
delicate shades of expression, fine distinctions of
phrase, or subtile beauties of style. Very likely
he does not pause to consider whether a style is
good or bad; and certainly he would be unable to
analyze its merits if he attempted this. It does
not follow that these graces do not touch him.
It is by means of them that deep and lasting effects
are produced. Susceptibility to artistic beauty is
not necessarily conscious. Frankly, it is to be admitted
that for the instant, evanescent, lurid success
of sensational popularity it is not necessary
to write good English. Books outside of the furthest
stretch of charity in workmanship and style
have, each in its day, the dazzling, however transient,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
success of a Roman candle or a rocket. In
far too many newspapers one may see how flippant
pertness and vulgar sharpness can dispense with
the smallest shred of good style, may ignore syntax,
scorn accuracy, and outrage decency itself.</p>

<p>Once for all it must be allowed that whoever
seeks this sort of success need not waste his time in
the study of English composition. The author of
the latest scandalous novel never experiences the
necessity of any exhaustive acquaintance with rhetoric,
or even of knowing much more than the outside
of the English grammar. The young women
who are employed by enterprising journals to scramble
around the world in the briefest possible time
with a hand-satchel for luggage are apt to be as
little encumbered with syntax as with trunks. The
purveyors of gossip to society papers are not in the
least obliged to know the language in which they
attempt to convey their precious information. If
they can discover that Mrs. Cholmondely-Jones
is at the Sea View House, their readers are not
troubled at the declaration that this leader of
fashion is &ldquo;stopping at the hotel for a week;&rdquo;&mdash;confusingly
impossible as such a feat may appear.</p>

<p>All this has been said over and over, and I repeat
it here simply by way of reminder that there
is no claim that popular success is not to be won
without literary merit; any more than it could
be claimed on the other hand that popular success
is insured by it. It is certain that no permanent
literary work can be accomplished without the
mastery of a good English style; and it is equally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>certain that command of written language is of the
highest value and use. Sensational books make
their way not because of their crudities of style
and their inaccuracies, but in spite of them. If
to the qualities which have given them vogue had
been added literary merit, they might have reached
to permanent in place of temporary success. Certainly
if a writer desires to impress, to persuade, to
move, to arouse; if he have a report to write which
he hopes may be adopted, a theory to state which he
is in earnest to have received; a history to relate
that he would have believed; an appeal that he
longs to have heeded, a creation of the imagination
by which he aims to touch the emotions of his
fellow-men, he cannot too carefully cultivate the
art of communicating it. In any of these cases
mastery of literary technique is as essential to success
as is air to breathing or light to seeing.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II">II</a></h2>

<p class="captitle">METHODS OF STUDY</p>


<p>The question remains: How is skill in composition
to be gained? The general principle is as
simple as the details of the craft are complicated.
The way to write is to write. Perhaps the most
exact image of the process is that of piano-playing.
Just as one acquires skill in the use of the piano by
innumerable exercises and continual practice, so
one attains to mastery in written language only by
writing and writing and writing. It is necessary
to compose and recompose; to write all sorts of
things, to prune them, recast them, polish them;
to elaborate and to simplify; to weigh each word
and phrase; and when all is done to destroy the
result as ruthlessly as we would destroy anything
else which has become rubbish by outliving its usefulness.</p>

<p>This last point needs to be insisted upon. Personal
vanity and that interest in self which is so
naturally and so universally human, work constantly
to persuade the beginner that his poorest
trials are worth preservation. In the case of the
pianist, the sound of the five-finger exercise dies
on the air, and there is luckily an end of it. The
player cannot gather it up and send it to a magazine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>He cannot even without great risk of encountering
personal violence impose it upon the
friend whom he has invited to dine. With the
writer it is unhappily different. His first verses
he sends cheerfully and a little condescendingly
to a magazine. His second he distributes on privately
printed slips to his friends,&mdash;and any acquaintance
will serve as a friend in the distribution
of privately printed poems! His third effort is apt
to go to some overworked man of letters, accompanied
by a note delicately hinting that the inclosure
is better than anything which the recipient has
done, and requesting him to have it published at
once in one of the leading magazines.</p>

<p>It is a thousand pities that the work of writers
who are learning their art is not written in ink
fading over night, or which would at least vanish
as soon as the manuscript had undergone revision.
The next best thing is for the would-be author to
accustom himself to phrasing thoughts in his mind
without setting them down upon paper at all. This
habit is of great value from the constant training
that it gives, and it is of value also because it takes
its place as the study of form for the sake of form;
the effort to attain technical excellence unhampered
by any consideration of producing compositions permanent
in themselves.</p>

<p>The best technical training is that which is entirely
disassociated from any idea that permanent
work is being done. No one can get on very well
or very far in English composition who is not able
patiently and faithfully to do a great deal of work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>simply for the sake of learning how to do it, entirely
realizing that the thing produced is of no
value when it is done. It is as absurd to preserve or
to attempt to publish these crude experiments as it
would be to practice the five-finger exercises in public,
and to attempt to persuade music-lovers to pay to
come and hear them. Every editor knows what need
there is of saying this. Each mail carries to the
office of every magazine scores of manuscript which
are nothing but the crude exercises produced in
more or less unintelligent struggles with the art of
composition. The soul of the editor faints within
him, while on the other hand the misguided, sensitive,
self-conscious writer is smitten to the heart
when his or her exercise is sent back with a printed
card declining it with a hollow mockery of thanks.
It is ludicrously pathetic; and I dwell upon it a
little because in my time I have been foolish enough
to offend in this manner; because as an editor I
suffered enough from this cause to square the account
beyond the cavil of the most exacting fate;
and because in the course of my literary life I have
seen so much of this sort of thing that I realize
how general the experience is. It would be of less
moment were it not for the depth of despair into
which would-be authors are plunged by the return
of these exercises. There is no despair like the despair
of youth, and it makes my heart tingle now to
recall the utter anguish with which I have received
rejected early manuscripts&mdash;which should never
have been sent to a publisher. Would to heaven
that there were some one eloquent enough to persuade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>the world once and for all that literature is
as surely a profession which must be learned as is
law or medicine. No delicate woman or sensitive
man, thrown suddenly upon her or his own resources,
turns to law or medicine, expecting to gain a livelihood
by practicing these professions uninstructed;
yet this would be hardly less logical than to expect
to make a way in literature without long preparation
and study. Nobody seems to believe this.
It is probably disbelieved now, as I say it; and
examples of persons who have succeeded in writing
with no apparent training come to mind at
once. It would be idle to retort to objections of
this sort that quacks have succeeded in all professions;
and I must content myself with insisting
that whether what I have been saying is believed
or not, it is true, and the proofs are heart-sickeningly
familiar to every man of literary experience
at all extended.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that the best technical
training is that in which nothing is considered
but technical excellence. The student should write
with his entire attention fixed upon the technical
excellence of the work. He must think not of
what he is doing, but of how he is doing it. It is
a long time before the student has a right to look
upon himself as a producer at all; and the more
completely he can preserve the attitude of a learner,
the better will be the results of his self-training.</p>

<p>Guy de Maupassant, one of the most finished
masters of literary art, pure and simple, who have
written in this century,&mdash;a writer who achieved
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>so much, and who lacked only a supreme ethical
ideal to do so much more,&mdash;indicates something of
what is meant by technical training in composition
in his account of his studies under Flaubert:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Flaubert, whom I saw sometimes, conceived a
friendship for me. I ventured to submit to him some
of my attempts. He kindly read them, and said to
me: &ldquo;I cannot tell whether you have talent. What
you have shown me proves a certain intelligence; but
you must not forget this, young man,&mdash;that talent,
in the phrase of Buffon, is only long patience. Work.&rdquo;
&hellip; For seven years I made verses, I made tales,
I made novels, I even made a detestable play. Of
them all nothing remains. The master &hellip; criticised
them, and enforced upon me, little by little, two or
three principles, which were the pith of his long and
perfect teaching. &ldquo;If one has not originality,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;it is necessary to acquire it.&rdquo; Talent is long
patience. It is a question of regarding whatever one
desires to express long enough and with attention close
enough to discover a side which no one has seen and
which has been expressed by nobody. In everything
there is something of the unexplored, because we are
accustomed to use our eyes only with the thought of
what has been already said concerning the thing we
see. The smallest thing has in it a grain of the unknown.
Discover it. In order to describe a fire that
flames or a tree in the plain, we must remain face to
face with that fire or that tree until for us they no
longer resemble any other tree or any other fire.
This is the way to become original.</p>

<p>Having, moreover, impressed upon me the fact
that there are not in the whole world two grains of
sand, two insects, two hands or two noses absolutely
alike, he forced me to describe a being or an object
in such a manner as to individualize it clearly, to distinguish
it from all other objects of the same kind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>&ldquo;When you pass,&rdquo; he said to me, &ldquo;a grocer seated in
his doorway, a concierge smoking his pipe, a row of
cabs, show me this grocer and this concierge, their
attitude, all their physical appearance; suggest by the
skill of your image all their moral nature, so that
I shall not confound them with any other grocer or
any other concierge; make me see, by a single word,
wherein a cab-horse differs from the fifty others that
follow or precede him.&rdquo; &hellip; Whatever may be the
thing which one wishes to say, there is but one word
for expressing it; only one verb to animate it, but one
adjective to qualify it. It is essential to search for
this verb, for this adjective, until they are discovered,
and never to be satisfied with anything else.&mdash;<i>Pierre
et Jean</i>, Introduction.</p></div>

<p>I have given this long quotation because it puts
the case so strongly, because it has the weight of
authority so high in technical matters, and because
it touches upon several points which will come up
later. There are dangers in this method of which
we shall speak in the proper place, but here the
thing to be emphasized is the absolute indispensability
of rigorous training when one is struggling
to acquire the art of verbal expression.</p>

<p>Robert Louis Stevenson, that beautiful master
of words, has also told us how he trained himself
to that dexterity and grace which have been the
delight of so great a company of readers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>All through my boyhood and youth, I was known
and pointed out for a pattern of an idler; and yet I
was always busy on my own private end, which was to
learn to write. I kept always two books in my pocket,
one to read, one to write in. As I walked, my mind
was busy fitting what I saw with appropriate words;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
when I sat by the roadside, I would either read, or a
pencil and a penny version-book would be in my hand
to note down the features of the scene or commemorate
some halting stanzas. Thus I lived with words. And
what I wrote thus was for no ulterior use. It was
written consciously for practice.&mdash;<i>A College Magazine.</i></p></div>

<p>It is well in learning to write to select uninteresting
subjects; themes which depend for their
effectiveness not upon what they are but upon the
way in which they are presented. It is the natural
tendency of any inexperienced writer to set to work
to find something to write about which is in itself
attractive. In the daily themes which I receive
from students I find that the almost inevitable
course of things is that the student writes upon
whatever romantic or striking incidents have occurred
in his life, and that when these are exhausted
he is utterly at a loss for something to write about.
It is not easy to persuade students that they will
get training far more valuable out of careful attempts
to express the commonplace. It is hard
for eager young writers to follow the advice which
Flaubert gave to De Maupassant. They are not
willing to put their most strenuous efforts into the
attempt to present vividly the grocer or the cab-horse.
Yet there is nothing more valuable in
training than to be thrown entirely upon one&rsquo;s own
literary skill, be it much or little. When one
deals with a subject fascinating in itself it is difficult
to determine how much of the force of what is
written depends upon the theme and how much
may fairly be attributed to the treatment. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>training which is purely technical it is essential to
make this distinction, and it follows that the learner
is wise to choose for his &rsquo;prentice efforts matters
little attractive in themselves.</p>

<p>I have said that the way to learn to write is to
write. It would perhaps be better to say that the
way to learn to write is to rewrite. In the careful
revision, the patient reconstruction, the unsparing
self-criticism of the student who is determined to
be satisfied with nothing short of the best of which
he is capable, lies the secret of success. Here, as
in everything else connected with the study of
technique, patient, painstaking, untiring work is
the essential thing.</p>

<p>In regard to revision it is necessary to call attention
to the fact that it must extend to the revision
of paragraphs and whole compositions. We are
apt to confine ourselves to the remodeling and the
polishing of sentences, or, if we get so far as to
revise paragraphs, to take each separately. It is
essential that we train ourselves to consider sentences
as part of paragraphs and paragraphs as but
portions of a whole. This it is especially hard for
untrained writers to do. Those who have taught
will recognize how difficult it is to make students
realize that the sentences of a theme may all be individually
right while yet the theme as a whole is
all wrong.</p>

<p>As a matter of practical work it is well to make
a schedule of chapters by paragraphs and of the
whole composition by chapters, if the work be on
so extensive a scale. It is one of the tests of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>a properly constructed paragraph that it can be
roughly summed up in a single sentence, and a
longer division may consequently be reduced in
substance to as many sentences as there are paragraphs.
It is an excellent plan thus to summarize
work, and a little practice enables a writer to do
this in his head without the trouble of putting the
abstract upon paper.</p>

<p>It is evident that to learn the art of composition
is no small undertaking, but it is to be kept in
mind that this art, being the means of human expression,
underlies all study and all thought no less
than it underlies all communication. It aids one
to understand what one reads, what one studies,
what one thinks, no less than it aids one to compose
a poem, to produce a novel, to write a letter,
or to relate the latest bit of piquant gossip. Do
not make the mistake of supposing that it is outside
of your other intellectual pursuits, save in the
sense that all the rest of your education is inclosed
in it. We fully understand only that which we
are ourselves capable of; and to comprehend the
literature of the world it is necessary to come as
near to being able to have produced it as is possible
to our individual capabilities.</p>

<h2><a name="III" id="III">III</a></h2>

<p class="captitle">PRINCIPLES OF STRUCTURE</p>


<p>Since it is the object of this book first of all to
be practical, it is well, before passing to matters
more intricate, to consider for a little the elementary
principles of composition.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Written language,
to repeat what everybody knows, consists of words
arranged in sentences, which in turn are grouped
into paragraphs, these again being placed together
to form whole compositions. In all composition,
it may be remarked, it is necessary to remember
that the punctuation is as integral and as important
a part of what is written as are the words. It is
often more easy to forgive the careless printer for
altering a word than for changing punctuation,
since the reader more easily corrects an error of
diction than of pointing. The student has not
mastered even the preliminary stages of composition
who is not as sure of the punctuation of a
page as he is of its grammatical construction.</p>

<p>There is a general vagueness on the subject of
the mechanical forms employed in written or
printed language which affects the nerves as if it
were connected with the moral laxity of the age.
There is probably no real connection between the
frequency of bank defalcations and a failure to
recognize the relative values of the comma and the
semicolon, but to a literary man this ignorance is
so culpable as almost to seem likely to lead to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>crime. When an inexperienced writer gets the
words down he is apt to suppose that all is well,
and frequently he does not even know when to
put in a period. It is necessary not only to close
a sentence when it is done, but also to bear in
mind that if it is not finished putting a period
in the middle does not really make two sentences
of it. When a tyro finds that his pen is getting
out of breath, he has a tendency to set down a
period, and then to go on with a conjunction, supposing,
in the innocency of his heart, that he is
beginning afresh. He is really only setting up
the divorced better half&mdash;for the latter portion
of a sentence should be the better half&mdash;in a sort
of separate maintenance. The period in such a
case has not even the power of a divorce, since it
cannot make the separation legal. A sentence is
like an ingot: if it be chopped in two, each piece
is half of the original whole. It must be melted
and recast to make individual ingots of smaller
size.</p>

<p>It is also to be noted that students too often fail
to recognize the fact that there are reasons as
definite and as binding for the divisions of sentences
into paragraphs as for the division of words
into sentences. A teacher recently told me of the
definition of a country schoolboy which, if not
over-elegant, represents pretty fairly, it seems to
me, the attitude of the common mind toward the
paragraph. &ldquo;A paragraph,&rdquo; this lad said blunderingly,
when called upon to define, &ldquo;why, a
paragraph&mdash;a paragraph&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a gob of sentences!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>I fancy that most teachers have encountered
plenty of pupils who think of a paragraph as
merely a &ldquo;gob&rdquo; of sentences,&mdash;a lump accidentally
broken off from the rest of the composition, but
possessed of no structural qualities of its own.</p>

<p>The analysis of sentences is common in schools,
but, so far as I know, there is little analysis of
paragraphs. To my thinking there is more to be
gained from the latter than from the former. The
analysis of the paragraph calls for a wider view,
for a better comprehension of subject, and for a
more developed idea of form. I do not wish to be
understood as endeavoring to invent a new torture
for pupils or one more device for further overburdening
teachers already overloaded. I merely
call attention to the value as a means of mental
and literary training of the study of paragraph
structure in the works of the masters of style, and
to the fact that such study is an indispensable part
of a literary training.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>Of course the ultimate appeal in all that concerns
the mechanics of composition is to what is
commonly called Good Use. All written symbols
by which intelligence is conveyed from man to
man are arbitrary. It is merely because it is
agreed that the character &ldquo;I&rdquo; shall represent a
sound and that this sound shall stand for an idea,
that we are able to bring up the idea in the mind
of others simply by writing the sign. That there
is nothing innate in the symbol is evident from
the fact that other signs have been used to represent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>this sound, and that other syllables have
stood for the pronoun in the first person singular.
The examples which might be given to illustrate
this point are limited only by the number of words
in existence. Consciously or by tacit consent&mdash;oftener,
of course, by the latter&mdash;it has been
agreed to attach sounds to ideas and to represent
those sounds by definite symbols. It follows that
he who wishes to communicate an idea in writing
has no resource outside of the means which have
been agreed upon by the consent of his fellow-men.
A writer may decide to have a new vocabulary and
to write it in novel characters. The difficulty is
that it will be understood by nobody. He is forced
to use the language of men, and to use it in the
fashion in which it is employed by others. He is
bound by the habit of men who write, established
by custom and defined by common acceptance. In
other words, he is constrained to follow Good Use.</p>

<p>Good Use is the general agreement in regard to
conventions by means of which ideas are conveyed.
It is the basis of all composition, and without an
intimate knowledge of it no one can write successfully.
What the best general agreement is, is to
be determined by the practice of the most eminent
and widely recognized authors. The fact of their
general indorsement and recognition is a sufficient
proof that their use is intelligible to their public,
and that it is therefore safe to follow them. Their
custom decides not because of their authority, but
because their reputation proves that their use is
the one which is tacitly accepted by intelligent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>readers, and which is therefore the only one that
will insure comprehension.</p>

<p>There are certain things which in writing it is
necessary to keep constantly in mind until they are
observed unconsciously and instinctively. Always
a writer must hold to three Principles of Structure
and three Principles of Quality. The division is
of course arbitrary, but it is logical and convenient.
The three Principles of Structure,&mdash;the mechanical
principles, so to say, those which direct
most obviously the mechanics of language,&mdash;are
Unity, Mass, and Coherence. The three Principles
of Quality&mdash;those which govern the inner and
more intellectual character of a composition&mdash;are
Clearness, Force, and Elegance.</p>

<p>The first principle of structure, Unity, has to do
with the substance of a sentence or a composition.
It is the law which requires that every composition
shall be informed with a general intention, shall
centre around one fundamental idea; that every
paragraph and every sentence shall be dominated
by one essential thought or purpose. It is the
principle which produces the difference between
a well-ordered whole and an unorganized collection
of scraps; between a rich embroidery and a sampler,
a mosaic and a crazy-quilt. Without Unity
as a whole a composition becomes as disjointed as
a dictionary, without attaining to the instructiveness
of that necessary book; and in degree only less
from the proportionate importance of a part to the
whole, the lack of Unity in a sentence destroys the
value and effectiveness of the entire work.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>
<p>The second principle, that of Mass, concerns the
external arrangement of what is written. It is the
rule which enjoins the putting of the chief parts of
the composition, of the paragraph and of the sentence,
in the places which most readily catch the
eye or the ear. This is sometimes spoken of as
Emphasis, but the term is hardly comprehensive
enough. All questions of proportion come of
course under the head of Mass, and so does whatever
in the outward form of a composition appeals
to the eye.</p>

<p>Coherence, the third principle of structure, is
the law of internal arrangement. The relation of
each part to the others must be made clear and unmistakable.
We are all but too familiar with the
style of writing which resembles the valley of dry
bones of the prophet&rsquo;s vision, composition wherein
the relation of one fragment to another is to be
discerned only by the most careful research. Coherence
is as the inspired prophecy of Ezekiel,
whereby the bones came together, bone to bone, so
that the valley was filled with an exceeding great
army.</p>

<p>Unity is at once the simplest and the most easily
secured of these three requirements. It is within
the power of any writer of reasonable judgment to
tell when the matter contained in a sentence concerns
a single idea or several ideas so closely connected
that they must belong together. It is a
matter of perception, and for avoiding incongruous
constructions there is perhaps no other rule so good
as the simple injunction: Be sure that sentences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>have Unity. Every text-book upon rhetoric warns
against this fault and contains examples of it.
The writer who accustoms himself to realize vividly
what he is saying is not likely to fall into the error.</p>

<p>The danger attending upon the effort to secure
Unity is that of Dryness. The writer who is excessively
careful about confining every sentence to
a single thought and every paragraph to a single
group of thoughts dominated by a central idea is
sometimes likely to fail of variety and richness of
structure. He becomes timid about admitting even
proper ornaments, and gives to his style an air of
being constructed upon the model of a wall of
brick masonry. Variety is as essential to composition
as is Unity, and it is necessary to be careful
lest in securing one the other be lost. Every student
should become sufficiently self-critical to know
in which direction he is more likely to err, and to
direct his efforts for improvement accordingly.</p>

<p>The question of Mass is more difficult. This
principle governs the places of words and clauses
in the sentence, of sentences in paragraphs, of
paragraphs in longer compositions. The whole
matter is admirably and succinctly put by Mr.
Wendell:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In any composition the points which most readily
catch the eye are evidently the beginning and the end.
From which, of course, it follows that, broadly speaking,
every composition&mdash;sentence, paragraph, chapter,
book&mdash;may conveniently begin and end with the
words which stand for ideas that we wish to impress
on our readers&hellip;. Broadly speaking, the office of
punctuation is to emphasize,&mdash;to do for the eye what
vocal pauses and stress do for the ear,&mdash;to show what
parts of a composition belong together, and among
these parts to indicate the most significant. It is
clear that periods emphasize more strongly than semi-colons;
and semi-colons than commas. From this, of
course, it follows that in an ideally massed sentence
the most significant words come close to the periods,
the less significant close to the lesser marks of punctuation,
the least significant in those unbroken stretches
of discourse where there is nothing but words to arrest
the eye. The test of a well-massed sentence, then, is
very simple: Are the words that arrest the eye the
words on which the writer would arrest your attention?</p></div>

<p>The application of this principle to books is
easily seen, and perhaps is especially obvious in
fiction. In an effective novel it will generally be
found that some interesting and striking situation
has been chosen for the beginning. Frequently
the author makes a bold plunge into the very heart
of the story in order to find an impressive passage
with which to begin. The more important emphasis,
that of the conclusion, must be properly employed
or the entire effect of the work as a whole
is sacrificed.</p>

<p>A good example of the ill effect of failing to
employ the emphatic points of a book properly is
afforded by Stanley J. Weyman&rsquo;s pleasing story,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
&ldquo;My Lady Rotha.&rdquo; The first seven chapters are
occupied with an account of the rebellion of a
village against its chatelaine and of her flight from
her castle to avoid their rage. Once the Lady
Rotha is free of the castle, however, the book is
devoted to her adventures in a country where the
King of Sweden, the great Wallenstein, and numerous
other leaders are filling the land with war and
danger and bloodshed. To the very end of the
tale the reader expects that the narrative will return
to the castle, and that there will appear some
better excuse for the opening chapters than the
need of starting the heroine on her perilous travels;
but the novel finishes without going back to the
castle or telling how matters were settled there.
The book is so badly massed that the very force of
its beginning injures instead of aiding the effect of
the whole.</p>

<p>In another and better tale by the same author,
&ldquo;A Gentleman of France,&rdquo; the first emphasis is
given to the poverty and undeserved ill fortune of
the hero; so that when in time fate leads him to
better things the later joy is heightened by contrast
with the earlier gloom. I take these two
books because they have been widely read of late,
but any novel that comes to hand is an illustration
of one sort or another.</p>

<p>The danger to be avoided in endeavoring to secure
effective massing of compositions is that of
artificiality. This is especially obvious in the construction
of sentences. In an uninflected language,
like English, wherein the relative places of words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
are necessarily fixed more or less absolutely, it is
not easy to re-order the arrangement without giving
to the style an appearance of artifice. Dexterously
to overcome this difficulty is one of the things
which the student has to learn, and perhaps more
upon the success with which he is able to do so
than upon any other single thing will depend the
effectiveness of what he writes.</p>

<p>The third principle of structure, Coherence, is
one of which the lack is easily perceptible, but the
securing of which is often difficult. The rule is
that words closely related by their share in the
thought to be conveyed shall be kept together,&mdash;and
so stated is simple enough. No one, however,
is likely to have written even a page upon any
subject at all intricate without having to pause to
rearrange the clauses of some involved sentence or
of some confused paragraph. A great hindrance
in the struggle for Coherence, it should be added,
is a want of clear perception of what one wishes to
say. The position of words is often determined
by the choice of shades of expression which are
extremely delicate, and unless the writer has an
accurate and acute perception of these he cannot
be sure of the order of his words and clauses.</p>

<p>It is easy enough to see how the phrases are
misplaced in the stock examples of incoherence
which are given in the books of rhetoric. Any
novice could improve a sentence of this sort:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He left off his old coat to marry a lady with a large
Roman nose which had been worn continuously for ten
years.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">It takes only a little thought to see the error in
the phrase:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The crowd turns, departs, disintegrates;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">where it is evident that the connection is between
&ldquo;turns&rdquo; and &ldquo;disintegrates,&rdquo; and that the crowd
departs after it has broken up. Not less obvious,
when attention is called to it, is the fault here:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The theory that the poet is a being above the world
and apart from it is true of him as an observer only
who applies to the phenomena about him the test of a

Letters of James Gates Percival</i>.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">If we say &ldquo;is true only of him who as an observer,&rdquo;
we shall mean one thing,&mdash;and I confess
to a suspicion that this is the thing which
Lowell intended!&mdash;whereas the passage as it stands

asserts that the theory is true considering the poet
as merely an observer.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to multiply examples. Every
student who attempts careful expression will come
upon illustrations enough in his own work. The
important thing is to be clearly aware of what is
to be said, and then to be sure that it is said, and
said unmistakably.</p>

<p>In the construction of sentences the coherent arrangement
of words is frequently hindered by the
grammatical relations; no such limitation prevents
the proper placing of sentences in the formation of
paragraphs. In the construction of paragraphs,
however, even more than in the construction of sentences,
is necessary the utmost clearness of ideas.
It is here essential to know not only what one has
to say, but the relative strength which should be
given to each link in the chain of thought. The
question of proportion must here have the fullest
answer. The relative stress which is to be given
by position and the relative stress which is to be
imparted by proportion are alike of the greatest
importance in the making of the paragraph.</p>

<p>Something of this may be shown by an example.
The following is a paragraph from the essay by
Jeffrey on &ldquo;The Characters in Shakespeare&rsquo;s
Plays:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Everything in him [Shakespeare] is in unmeasured
abundance and unequaled perfection,&mdash;but everything
so balanced and kept in subordination, as not to
jostle or disturb or take the place of another. The
most exquisite poetical conceptions, images, and descriptions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
are given with such brevity, and introduced
with such skill as merely to adorn without loading the
sense they accompany&hellip;. All his excellences, like
those of nature herself, are thrown out together; and
instead of interfering with, support and recommend
each other.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Let this now be read with a transposition of
sentences:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Although in Shakespeare everything is so balanced
and kept in subordination as not to jostle or disturb
or take the place of another, and is in unequaled perfection,
yet everything is in an unmeasured abundance.
He gives with such brevity and introduces with such
skill as to adorn without loading the sense they accompany,
the most exquisite poetical conceptions, images,
and descriptions. All his excellences, although they
support and recommend instead of interfering with each
other, are thrown out together like those of nature
herself.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">The words and phrases are identical in these two
paragraphs, save for the slight alterations and
changes of connectives made necessary by transposition;
and yet the effect is distinctly different.
The first, as Jeffrey intended, remarks that in spite
of the great luxuriance of Shakespeare&rsquo;s work it is
always well ordered; the second declares that although
well ordered the poet&rsquo;s work is as luxurious
as nature herself.</p>

<p>If the proportion were changed, the effect would
be varied again. Cutting out a few clauses from the
original, we have:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Everything in Shakespeare is so balanced and kept
in subordination as not to jostle or disturb or take the
place of another. The most poetical conceptions are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
given with such brevity and introduced with such skill
as merely to adorn without loading the sense they accompany.
All his excellences are thrown out together,
and instead of interfering with, support and recommend
each other.</p></div>

<p>Here Shakespeare&rsquo;s fine ordering of his style is
made more emphatic than in the original, and a
glance will show how, by the suppression of other
phrases, the luxuriance of his work could have been
given the more prominence. A writer must know
which of many possible shades of meaning is the
one which he desires to convey, and he is likely to
be successful in his work or the reverse according
to the sharpness of his own apprehension of what
he is aiming at. The gunner who shuts his eyes
when he fires is more likely to hit the mark than is
the writer who vaguely endeavors to say something
likely to succeed in accurately saying anything.</p>

<h2><a name="IV" id="IV">IV</a></h2>

<p class="captitle">DETAILS OF DICTION</p>


<p>The student who endeavors to apply to words
the tests of Good Use finds himself confronted
with some questions which are very easily answered
and with others so difficult that even the experts
of language may disagree concerning them. It is
of course to be supposed that we have all mastered
the canons which forbid the use of Barbarisms,
Improprieties, and Solecisms,&mdash;however much we
allow ourselves to be influenced by the newspapers
into the habit of violating them. We have not
got through our early school years without having
our attention called to the difference of effect produced
by long and short words. Most of us have
had more or less confusing instruction on the subject
of the use of Latin words and words which
are somewhat inexactly termed Anglo-Saxon. We
have all known brief but bewildered intervals during
which we endeavored to live up to a noble
resolution to make our vocabulary strongly Anglo-Saxon;
and we are most of us conscious in our
secret hearts that we neither did this ever, nor
ever for a moment knew how to set to work to
do it.</p>

<p>It is as well for the written language of to-day
that there has never been possible a practical revision
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>of the tongue by the dropping of words of
Latin origin. It is a most mistaken notion which
turns attention to the race origin of words instead
of directing study to their actual force in use. It
sounds admirably learned to talk of a diction which
is too strongly Latin or which is markedly Anglo-Saxon;
it is possible enough to see that in general
a preponderance of classical words imparts dignity
and that an abundance of Saxon gives terseness to
a style; but the man who in desiring to secure the
one effect or the other goes to work to select his
language on this basis is utterly ignoring the very
first principles of practical composition. Words
are to be chosen with reference to a desired effect,
and their pedigree is of no more consequence than
is that of the players on a foot-ball team. The
boys of one descent may do better than those of
another, and words of one or of another derivation
may produce a desired effect,&mdash;but the contrary
may be true, so that such a principle of selection is
as absurd in one case as in the other.</p>

<p>Of long and short words much the same might be
said. We are pretty well out of the days when it
was still needful to insist upon the admonition of
Frere:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And don&rsquo;t confound the language of the nation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With long-tailed words in <i>osity</i> and <i>ation</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">The childish love of fine words which belongs to
the infancy of literature is generally outgrown. It
is recognized that words are to be selected solely
for their effect, and not for extraneous pretensions.
In this way is to be made the choice between words
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
general and specific, and of words literal or figurative.</p>

<p>A consideration which is of importance in the
choice of words, and one with which we shall be
concerned later on, is that of denotation and connotation.
A word denotes what it expresses directly;
it connotes what it expresses indirectly;
it denotes the idea which it names, and connotes
the idea that it implies; it denotes what it says,
and connotes what it suggests. The word &ldquo;Washington&rdquo;
denotes a particular man, whose history
we know, but with that history go so many suggestions
and associations that the name connotes
the idea of patriotism, military skill, and devotion
to the nation from the very hour of its birth.
The word &ldquo;treason&rdquo; denotes a specific offense
against the government; while it connotes all the
shame with which men regard one who betrays his
country. In the familiar line of Wordsworth,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A violet by a mossy stone,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">the words denote a certain common flower beside a
stone covered with another common and ordinary
vegetable growth; they connote all the beauty of
the azure blossom, the sweetness of the springtide,
the quietude of a sylvan scene, all those lovely and
touching associations which can be expressed only
by suggestion. It is in the fact that certain sentiments
can be conveyed by indirect means only that
the value of connotation lies. To suggest by the
choice of words those delicate and subtle ideas
which are like a fragrance or like the iridescent
sheen of nacre is one of the highest triumphs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
literary art; and the nice artist in words is certainly
not less careful in regard to the connotation
of words than he is of their denotation.</p>

<p>One of the things which often puzzles beginners
is how to increase their vocabulary. Of course
reading is one of the most effective means of enlarging
one&rsquo;s knowledge of the language,&mdash;but it is
only careful reading, reading in which are studied
the force and the color of terms as well as their
literal meaning, that is of any marked value in this
direction. It is said that Thackeray was in the
habit of studying the dictionary with a frank purpose
of adding to his knowledge of words. I have
known two literary men who followed this practice,
but they both deliberately selected unusual and
bizarre examples with the avowed object of adding
a unique and whimsical flavor to their journalistic
work. Such an example is of course to be shunned,
but in general there is far too little stress laid upon
the use of the dictionary. There should be in
every preparatory school a regular exercise in the
use of the dictionary, and in it all students should
be required to join. The teacher should read an
extract or a sentence, or should give out words to
the class, and have the meanings and derivations
actually looked up at the moment. The differing
values of synonyms should be examined; and if
possible something of the history of the words
given. The aim should be to encourage the student
in the habit of having a lexicon at hand and
of using it constantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Another important means of increasing one&rsquo;s
command of language is conversation, and the
value of conversation in this respect as in every
other is in direct ratio to its character. To talk
is not enough; it is necessary that the talker exert
himself to do his best. Chatter is of no value as
intellectual training; it is the exercise of the mind
which tells. The subject of conversation may be
as light as possible; but it is important that whatever
is said is said well, whether it be a compliment
to a mistress&rsquo; eyebrow, a discussion of the deepest
philosophy of life, or the latest bon-mot of the clubs.
&ldquo;Every variety of gift,&rdquo; Emerson says truly,&mdash;&ldquo;science,
religion, politics, letters, art, prudence,
war, or love,&mdash;has its vent and exchange in conversation,&rdquo;
and it follows that conversation properly
conducted helps to the power of expression in all
of these.</p>

<p>Better than all other means of increasing the
vocabulary, however, is writing. Always the way
to learn to write is to write. The way to increase
one&rsquo;s power of expression is to strive to express.
The habit of seeking constantly for the right word
results in ability to find the right word. It acts
not only directly, widening one&rsquo;s domain in the
realm of language, but it renders a hundred-fold
more effective the use of reading and of talk. It
puts the mind into an attentive mood so that when
a new term is met with it is remembered. The
perception on the alert for words becomes susceptible
to them, so that they are appreciated and retained.
Cultivate the habit of putting things into
words and the words will come unconsciously; practice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>phrasing thought and the means of phrasing
it will not long be wanting.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>When we go on from the consideration of words
to that of sentences we find that here Good Use is
more clearly defined. The rules for the construction
of sentences are to a large extent more formal
than those which govern the choice of terms, and
the most obvious of them are conveniently collected
and arranged under the name of Grammar.</p>

<p>Grammar is the account-book of custom; it is
in reality a reckoning up of the popular suffrages
in regard to verbal proprieties. In other words,
grammar is the formal statement of the decisions
of Good Use in so far as they apply to the relative
forms of words. It is of course not necessary to
speak here in detail of these. I only wish to call
attention to the rules of the grammarian as a particularly
well defined example of the supremacy of
Good Use in all matters relating to language and
its employment in literature. It is because the
general consent has decided that a certain form of
the verb shall be plural that the grammarian declares
it to be in that number. Grammars follow
and formulate custom; they neither precede nor
dictate.</p>

<p>The inability of the grammarian to dictate to
custom is made especially evident when we consider
that thing more subtle than syntax and in composition
no less important, which we call Idiom. That
a writer shall be idiomatic is as essential to writing
well as the avoidance of solecisms, yet every student
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>of the language knows how elusive and difficult
of attainment is a sound understanding of the
idioms of any tongue.</p>

<p>An idiom is the personal&mdash;if the word may be
allowed&mdash;the personal idiosyncrasy of a language.
It is a method of speech wherein the genius of the
race making the language shows itself as differing
from that of all other peoples. What style is to
the man that is idiom to the race. It is the crystallization
in verbal forms of peculiarities of race
temperament&mdash;perhaps even of race eccentricities.</p>

<p>It is customary to define an idiom as the form
of language which cannot be translated into another
tongue; and the example which is commonly given
is the habit English-speaking peoples have of saying:
&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; whereas the Latin form&mdash;literally
translated&mdash;would be: &ldquo;You speak rightly,&rdquo;
the French: &ldquo;You have reason,&rdquo; and the German:
&ldquo;You have right.&rdquo; An idiom is independent of
grammatical rules,&mdash;sometimes is in distinct violation
of them. It makes us say: &ldquo;A ten-foot pole,&rdquo;
&ldquo;A two-dollar bill,&rdquo; &ldquo;A five-acre lot,&rdquo;&mdash;where
a plural adjective modifies a singular substantive,
or to speak more accurately is compounded with it.
It decides that we shall write: &ldquo;More [friends]
than one friend has told me,&rdquo;&mdash;although the subject
of &ldquo;told&rdquo; is &ldquo;friends&rdquo; understood. An idiom
boldly ignores the derivation of words. Since
&ldquo;circumstances&rdquo; means &ldquo;things standing around,&rdquo;
it is evidently logical to use the phrase, &ldquo;in these
circumstances.&rdquo; The genius of the language decides
that the form shall be, &ldquo;under these circumst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>ances;&rdquo;
and whoever writes &ldquo;in&rdquo; for &ldquo;under&rdquo;
not only uses unidiomatic English, but lays himself
open to the charge of pedantry. Untranslatable
and above rules, Idiom is as inviolable as the
laws of the Medes and the Persians, and for him
who sins against it there is no pardon.</p>

<p>For idioms there is no law save that of Good Use,
and perhaps in the discernment of no other rules
is required so critical and so nice a discrimination.
English which is not idiomatic becomes at once
formal and lifeless, as if the tongue were already
dead and its remains embalmed in those honorable
sepulchres, the philological dictionaries. On the
other hand, English which goes too far, and fails
of a delicate distinction between what is really and
essentially idiomatic and what is colloquial, becomes
at once vulgar and utterly wanting in that subtle
quality of dignity for which there is no better term
than distinction. The grammarian, moreover,
wageth against Idiom a warfare as bitter as it is
unceasing. It is distinctly idiomatic to use in certain
cases what is known as the &ldquo;flat adverb,&rdquo;&mdash;the
adverb in the adjective form without <i>ly</i>. The
man who writes &ldquo;speak loudly,&rdquo; &ldquo;speak more
loudly,&rdquo; &ldquo;speak plainly,&rdquo; &ldquo;walk fastly,&rdquo; &ldquo;drink
deeply,&rdquo; &ldquo;speak lowly,&rdquo; &ldquo;the moon shines brightly,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the sun shines hotly,&rdquo; may have the applause of
grammarians and his own misguided conscience,
but he is not writing idiomatic English. His virtue
must be its own reward, since he can never win
the approval of lovers of sound, wholesome, living
English. Those who use the language idiomatically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>write &ldquo;speak loud,&rdquo; &ldquo;speak louder,&rdquo; &ldquo;speak
plain,&rdquo; &ldquo;walk fast,&rdquo; &ldquo;drink deep,&rdquo; &ldquo;speak low,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the moon shines bright,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the sun shines
hot.&rdquo; Yet these idiomatic distinctions are often
very delicate. An adverb is sometimes properly
used in its flat form with an imperative when in
other cases the form in <i>ly</i> is proper. We say,
for instance, &ldquo;walk slow, walk slower;&rdquo; but &ldquo;He
walked slowly across the field and more slowly
over the bridge.&rdquo; Nothing but the careful training
of the perceptions avails for distinctions such as
these.</p>

<p>Another idiomatic construction against which
the purist waggeth his tongue and gritteth his
teeth is the ending of a sentence with a particle.
Instead of the good old idiomatic &ldquo;Where does
it come from?&rdquo; he would have us say &ldquo;Whence
does it come?&rdquo; For &ldquo;Where is it going to?&rdquo;
he offers &ldquo;Whither is it going?&rdquo; Both of his
phrases are eminently respectable, but there is
sometimes a lack of vitality in too eminent respectability!
Do not be afraid to say: &ldquo;The subject
which I spoke to you about;&rdquo; &ldquo;The conclusion
that we came to;&rdquo; &ldquo;The man whom I talked
with;&rdquo; &ldquo;This is a cause to stand up for;&rdquo; &ldquo;It
is worth living for;&rdquo; &ldquo;A name to conjure with;&rdquo;
and the allied phrases which would never have
been tolerated for an instant if the language had
been made in libraries instead of having grown
up in the lives of peoples and on the tongues of
breathing men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>Professor Reed, of the University of Pennsylvania,
admirably says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The false fastidiousness which shuns a short particle
at the end of a sentence is often fatal to a force
which belongs to the language in its primal character.</p></div>

<p>He points out that only the misapplication of
analogies from Continental languages has brought
into discredit this characteristic English idiom.
He quotes Bacon, &ldquo;Houses are built to live in, and
not to look on;&rdquo; Donne, &ldquo;Hath God a name to
curse by?&rdquo; and Burke, &ldquo;The times we live in.&rdquo;
He might have gone to contemporary authors, and
cited Stevenson, &ldquo;After expedients hitherto unthought
of,&rdquo; &ldquo;He was all fallen away and fallen
in;&rdquo; James, &ldquo;The different bedrooms she has successively
slept in,&rdquo; &ldquo;There is almost literally nothing
he does not care for;&rdquo; Newman, &ldquo;The elect
are few to choose out of;&rdquo; Lowell, &ldquo;In accomplishing
what he aimed at,&rdquo; &ldquo;The words are chosen
for their value to fill in,&rdquo; &ldquo;The soil out of which
such men as he are made is good to be born on,
good to live on, good to die for and be buried in.&rdquo;
It would not be difficult to extend the list until
it should include all the writers of idiomatic English.</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, to add here a word of
warning. Allowing a particle to come at the end
of a sentence or clause because it belongs there
idiomatically is one thing; letting the particle drag
loosely along behind from a lack of skill or energy
sufficient to manage the construction properly is
quite another. Idiom is a cloak which may be
made to cover as many vices as virtues. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>beginning and end of clause or sentence are the
emphatic parts, and to give the close to an unimportant
word is to waste an opportunity and
weaken the effect of the whole. The reason why
the idiomatic final particle is permissible is because
it really belongs to the emphatic idea or is practically
a part of the verb which precedes it. In the
phrase &ldquo;the times we live in,&rdquo; it is evident that
&ldquo;in&rdquo; is in intention part of the idea expressed by
the verb, so that the sentence does not close with
the particle &ldquo;in&rdquo; but with the verb &ldquo;live in;&rdquo;
and so on for the other examples which have been
quoted.</p>

<p>A common instance of unidiomatic use of a particle
at the end of a sentence is that of closing with
the sign of the infinitive. &ldquo;Do as you have a mind
to&rdquo; is bad English because the words &ldquo;mind&rdquo; and
&ldquo;to&rdquo; do not in idea belong together. Either the
verb should be expressed,&mdash;&ldquo;Do as you have
a mind to do,&rdquo; or the sentence should be recast.
However strong colloquial precedent may seem, do
not allow that forlornly orphaned sign of the infinitive
to come trailing along alone as a last word.</p>

<p>The idiomatic use of conjunctions is one mark
of a finished and careful style. It is perhaps too
much to say that if a writer takes care of his particles
the other parts of speech will take care of
themselves, but it is at least true that no style can
be lucid and polished in which the particles&mdash;and
especially the conjunctions&mdash;have not been looked
to most carefully. Amateur writers are apt to
seem aware of the existence of only two conjunctions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>&ldquo;
and&rdquo; and &ldquo;but;&rdquo; while they are especially
careful to omit the conjunction &ldquo;that.&rdquo; It has been
remarked that one of the important means by which
the French masters secure that wonderful clarity
and vivacity of style which so few English authors
have been able to approach is a careful and explicit
discrimination of the value of connectives. A
stylist might be not very inaccurately defined as a
writer who is always conscientious in his choice of
conjunctions. Coleridge&rsquo;s remarks on this point
have often been quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A close reasoner and a good writer in general may
be known by his pertinent use of connectives. Read
that page of Johnson; you cannot alter one conjunction
without spoiling the sense. It is in a linked
strain throughout. In your modern books for the
most part, the sentences in a page have the same connection
with each other that marbles have in a bag;
they touch without adhering.&mdash;<i>Table Talk</i>, May 15,
1833.</p></div>

<p>This is impatiently inexact, it may be, but the
modern tendency, especially in careless newspaper
work, is to do away with connectives for the sake
of securing briskness. The result is abruptness
always and confusion generally. Insignificant as
they seem, connectives are the articulations of the
skeleton of a composition, and unless they be flexible
and delicately adjusted there is no possibility
of freedom of movement in the whole.</p>

<p>Certain weak idioms which are common in conversation
are apt to creep into the writings of those
not over sensitive to literary effects, but these colloquialisms
are religiously avoided by careful writers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
An example of this sort of thing is the detestable
use of &ldquo;got&rdquo;&mdash;as a substitute for &ldquo;have&rdquo; or as
a superfluous appendage to it,&mdash;which is so conspicuous
a vice in England. In America this is
at least theoretically frowned upon, and indeed it
is protested against by the best authorities on the
other side of the water.</p>

<p>Of course I have not space to take up one by
one all the idiomatic expressions of the language.
These given will serve as examples, and I have
but to add that there is perhaps no better way
of becoming sensitive to idiom than by conversing
with rustics and reading the English classics.
Neither method is of value without the restraining
and enlightening influence of sound good judgment,
but the student who is able to criticise his own
work and compare it with that of the masters will
find the talk of country folk and the works of the
old masters alike helpful in the formation of an
idiomatic style.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>The matter of long sentences or short sentences
is practically the same as that of long or short
words. The question is what effect the writer
wishes to produce. If he desires to treat a subject
with dignity, to impress by gravity of manner, or
to produce a mood of solemnity or melancholy, it
is all but essential that his sentences shall be long.
If on the other hand it is his object to produce an
effect of lightness, to induce a feeling of gayety, of
briskness, to make the blood run swiftly in the
veins, his style will be crisp with short sentences.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>With even a limited amount of literary training
the choice of length in sentences becomes almost
instinctive.</p>

<p>Something of the same principle is to be applied
to sentences loose and sentences periodic. A loose
sentence is one in which the meaning and the
grammatic structure are complete at some point before
the end; a periodic sentence is one in which
sense and sentence end together. If I say, &ldquo;We
all praise periodic sentences, but few of us write
them,&rdquo; I have given an example of the truth of
the statement. The sense and the grammatic construction
are both complete at the middle of the
sentence. If this be rewritten so as to read,
&ldquo;Although we all praise periodic sentences, few of
us write them,&rdquo; we have a periodic form in which
sense and construction are alike incomplete until
the close.</p>

<p>That closeness of structure which in an inflected
language is imparted by the form of words must in
English depend upon word arrangement; and from
this it follows that the question of making the sentence
periodic must be subordinate to the matter
of bringing the right words together. The tendency
of the language is toward a loose structure;
but between the two sorts of sentences that we are
considering there is the difference that there is
between giving to a person a thing in pieces and
giving it to him whole. In the loose sentence you
present to him one portion after another, often in
a way which leaves him uncertain at the end of the
different parts whether there is or is not more to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>come; in the periodic, you offer to him the whole
at once. Evidently the latter is the more definite,
the more precise, the more finished. It is, however,
so often impossible to make a sentence periodic
without apparent effort that no style could be
wholly periodic without seeming elaborately and
even painfully studied; hence as a matter of fact
all good style consists of a judicious mingling of
the two kinds of sentence.</p>

<p>The danger in a style too uniformly periodic is
that of appearing stiff and formal; and it seems to
be true that the best and most flexible English
contains a larger portion of loose sentences than
of periodic. Reaching out my hand for volumes
which chance to be within arm&rsquo;s length of my
writing-table, I find that of the first fifteen sentences
in Lowell&rsquo;s essay on Chaucer, ten are loose
and five periodic; of the same number at the
beginning of Henry James&rsquo; essay on Balzac, nine
are loose and six periodic; at the commencement
of Stevenson&rsquo;s paper on Burns the loose are to the
periodic eight to seven; Saintsbury&rsquo;s essay on De
Quincey begins with the same proportions; while
that by the same author on Sydney Smith opens
with thirteen loose relieved but by two periodic.
Of course such examples are not conclusive, but
they are at least illustrative.</p>

<p>In all these matters the important thing is to
train one&rsquo;s self to do whatever it seems well to do,
by the use of the form most apt for the effect
desired. Since the natural tendency of the untrained
writer is towards loose sentences, it is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
to conquer the art of writing periodically. In this,
as in all points of the study of composition, the
thing aimed at is to be able to do with language
whatever is desired; to become as absolutely master
of it as the cunning sculptor is master of the
modeling-clay, which is as plastic under his hand as
if it were a part of his very thought.</p>

<p class="captitle">PRINCIPLES OF QUALITY</p>


<p>When an architect builds a palace, or an edifice
no matter how much humbler, he first attends to the
unity, the proportions, and to the strength of the
structure; after that he has to consider the harmony,
the finish, and the adornment. According to the
nature and purpose of the building, it may be given
a coat of mineral paint, such as that which made
the transient fortune of Silas Lapham, it may be
set with clustering statues like an Old World cathedral,
or it may be jeweled with precious marbles
and flower-bright mosaics like the Taj Mahal.</p>

<p>The analogy between this process and that of
the writer is close enough to excuse the somewhat
florid comparison. First is to be considered the
mechanical form of what is written; unity, proportion,
and texture must be looked to, and afterward
there must be thought of the harmony, finish, and
adornment. When we have studied the Principles
of Structure,&mdash;Unity, Mass, and Coherence,&mdash;we
have next to do with the Principles of Quality.</p>

<p>Whatever work interests a reader may be said
to touch him in one of three ways: it may appeal
to his understanding, to his emotions, or to his
imagination. In other words, it may affect him by
its intellectual, by its emotional, or by its imaginative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>or æsthetic quality. Bearing in mind that any
nomenclature is a matter of convenience, and that
we use names chiefly as a means of dividing the
subject into portions which may be handled less
awkwardly than the whole, we may call these three
qualities Clearness, Force, and Elegance.</p>

<p>If we examine our feelings in regard to anything
which we read, we find that it has been easily intelligible,
or that it has bothered our comprehension;
it has interested us, stirred us, or has left us indifferent
or bored; and it has or has not produced
in us a sense of beauty and elevation of mood.
Neither these sensations nor the qualities which
produce them are sharply separable; but the distinctions
perceptibly exist, so that for purposes of
study the qualities may conveniently be treated
one at a time. It is easy to see that in understanding
the meaning of a thing we most markedly
use the intellectual faculties; that in liking or disliking
we respond to an appeal to the emotions;
and that in feeling beauty and appreciating the
æsthetic, we necessarily employ the imagination.
The first is a question of comprehension; the second
of feeling; and the third of taste. Clearness
is the intellectual principle of style; Force the
emotional; and Elegance the æsthetic.</p>

<p>The Principles of Structure must precede and
underlie those of Quality. Speaking broadly, we
may say that it is idle to attempt to give to a composition
or to a sentence Clearness, Force, or Elegance,
unless it is already satisfactory in Unity,
Mass, and Coherence. The closest attention to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>laws of mechanical form, however, is not sufficient
to secure quality. For the secret of that it is needful
to go further.</p>

<p>It is in Clearness that the Principles of Quality
are most obviously associated with those of Structure.
If an author has carefully considered the
Unity of his composition, if he has massed it properly
in parts and as a whole, if he has looked well
to its Coherence,&mdash;it is hardly possible that he
should fail of being readily understood. Close
attention to the mechanics of style will generally
make a writer intelligible, provided always that he
wishes his meaning to be apprehended easily, and
that he himself knows what he is attempting to say.</p>

<p>These two considerations are of much practical
importance. Sometimes writers do not choose to
be clear. George Meredith seems often to write
with the deliberate intention of forcing the reader
to go slowly,&mdash;as if from the feeling that what
can be read rapidly is in danger of being merely
skimmed over. There are others, like Thomas
Carlyle, who deliberately obscure what they write,
apparently in the hope of adding by complexity an
air of mystery to commonplaces and a meretricious
dignity to wisdom.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, this sentence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If for the present, in our Europe, we estimate the
ratio of Ware to Appearance of Ware so high even
as One to a Hundred (which, considering the Wages
of a Pope, Russian Autocrat, or English Game-Preserver,
is probably not far from the mark),&mdash;what
almost prodigious saving may there not be anticipated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>as the Statistics of Imposture advances, and so the
manufacture of Shams (that of Realities rising into
clearer and clearer distinction therefrom) gradually
declines, and at length becomes all but wholly unnecessary!&mdash;Carlyle:
<i>Sartor Resartus</i>, ii. 3.</p></div>

<p>Here the lack of lucidity is intentional. The
author has sacrificed it to the particular effect
which he wished to produce. He sought to give to
what he wrote an air of bizarre and piquant individuality,
and it is for this that he so distorts and
convulses his sentences. The purpose is as conscious
as that which informs the gyrations of an
acrobat. There is the same relation between a
page of &ldquo;Sartor Resartus&rdquo; or the &ldquo;French Revolution&rdquo;
and a page of ordinary prose that there is
between the marvelous distortions of a contortionist
and the walk of a gentleman,&mdash;each, of course,
being well in its place.</p>

<p>Compare with the sentence just given, this passage
from an undergraduate&rsquo;s theme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Chaucer&rsquo;s influence on the language was great, and
he helped to put the language before the people in a
way that had not been done before, so that it is evident
that there was a great result from this. This was
because he helped to change the English language, and
in this way he was very influential in affecting the
language.</p></div>

<p>Here an unhappy youth, engaged in all but mortal
combat with an examination paper, was endeavoring
to say something when he had nothing to say.
Of course he could not but fail, since it is impossible
to show clearly what one does not see clearly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>With these put also this, which again is from an
undergraduate&rsquo;s theme:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If the student respects a professor, as many do,
he can show his respect in many ways; if he does not,
and there are teachers who do not command the respect
of students (I do not consider the question to
be confined to this school, and in some colleges there
are men on the Faculty who are not respected, nor do
they deserve to be) and I think a man should raise
his hat only to ladies or to gentlemen that have ladies
with them.</p></div>

<p>Here the writer knew fairly well what he wished
to say, although he had not taken the trouble to
think it out very sharply. His difficulty was that
he lacked technical skill in expression.</p>

<p>These examples illustrate the causes from which
obscurity may arise. The first is legitimate.
Whether we agree that Carlyle or George Meredith
or Browning has carried obscurity beyond the farthest
limit at which it is permissible has nothing to
do with the fact that there are times when it is the
right of an author to sacrifice Clearness to some
other effect which he seeks. It is, however, fair to
say that in ordinary experience these emergencies
are pretty nearly as rare as the appearance of white
blackbirds; and that at least no writer has a right
to discard Clearness until he has secured it. Certainly
no one can successfully employ obscurity as
a means of producing literary effect until he has
acquired the art of writing with transparent simplicity.</p>

<p>Of the second cause it is sufficient to say here
that no outward aid can enable the student to overcome
it. To think sharply and lucidly is the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of self-discipline. It is a matter of mental
exercise, and while a student may be sent to a
mental as to a physical gymnasium, all strengthening
of the mind as of the muscles must be the result
of individual exertion. There has as yet been
discovered no system of intellectual <i>massage</i>, by
means of which the understanding may attain to
the benefits of work without doing anything.</p>

<p>While rules or wise maxims help little in this
matter of mental clearness, it is a thing so important
and so universally essential in all intellectual
training that it is difficult to pass it without a
word more. If a new Dante were to people a new
Inferno with sinners guilty of crimes intellectual,
as the stern old Florentine peopled his with those
who violated moral laws, the most populous circle
would be devoted to those who mistakenly think
themselves to think. There is a discouragingly
large portion of mankind whose mental processes
are apparently those of the oyster. They are
mentally so indolent or incapable that the labor
of reflecting is entirely beyond them. No student
can afford to remain in doubt as to whether he
really thinks, or merely indulges in vague mental
impressions which are to genuine thought as is
the dull smouldering of a heap of wet leaves in
a November fog to a brisk beech-wood fire on a
wide hearth in a winter night.</p>

<p>Macaulay is right when he says: &ldquo;Propriety of
thought and propriety of diction are commonly
found together&hellip;. Obscurity of expression generally
springs from confusion of ideas.&rdquo; He might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
have added that it is of great importance that the
writer be able to think of his subject as a whole.
It is easy for the mind to grasp a small thing and
it is proportionately harder for it to seize upon a
greater; yet upon the power to hold work in the
mind in its entirety must as surely depend success
in writing as does all vigorous mental development.</p>

<p>The third cause of obscurity, inability to express
the thought which one has, is at once the most
common, and the most inexcusable. Here we are
dealing with a tangible thing, to a great extent a
matter of rule, and, at most, largely a question of
study. There is no reason why a person of ordinary
intelligence should not be able to express whatever
he is able to think. Indeed, whoever has fully
thought out an idea has already phrased it, and if
he has even a moderate amount of training in composition
should have no difficulty in expressing it
on paper if he will but take the necessary pains.</p>

<p>It is evident that what is clear to one reader may
be obscure to another. It follows that the first
question to be decided is to what audience a composition
is to be addressed. Few of us can understand
this sentence from a treatise on comparative
embryology.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The inner wall of each of the paired cavities forms
a splanchnopleuric mesoblast, and the outer wall of the
whole the somatic mesoblast.</p></div>

<p>This is clear to readers who understand the technical
language of embryology; and for them the
author wrote. Parallel examples might be given
which would show how many sorts of writing there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>are which are clear to a limited audience only.
The reports of base-ball games are unintelligible to
the average English reader, while to the American
the notes on cricket are equally meaningless. The
criticisms of artists upon pictures seldom convey
a definite impression to those not versed in the
technical language of painting; and the same principle
holds throughout all sorts of literature.</p>

<p>The whole matter then resolves itself into the
simple maxim: Use the language of those addressed.
There is somewhere a story of a lady who always
spoke to her maid in French, because in taking the
situation the girl had wrongfully claimed to know
that tongue. The mistress held stubbornly to the
position that the maid should understand, and she
endured the discomforts of never being well served
rather than abandon it. Much writing and not
a little talking is all but as absurd. Constantly
authors address themselves to the general public in
language which they know or might know the general
public will not understand. Whatever else
the human race may be, it is not logical; there
are few of us free from the fault of sometimes acting
upon assumptions which we know to be false;
and nowhere is this fact more strikingly illustrated
than in composition.</p>

<p>This question of using the language of those
addressed is one which meets every teacher at the
very threshold of the class-room. The best instructor
is not he who knows most, but he who
imparts most; and he imparts most who most perfectly
speaks the language of his pupils. It is of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
no use daily to fire over the heads of children
all the wisdom of Solomon if it be embodied in
a language which is not theirs. The teacher who
really teaches does not take the attitude of the
lady whose maid should have known French; he
does not assume that pupils should understand
what he says; he simply considers whether as a
matter of fact they do understand. If they do not,
he sets himself with patience to re-phrase it, and,
if need be, re-phrase again, until he has put it into
language which the children cannot fail to comprehend.
It is not a question of what might be understood
but of what must be. It is true that this
calls for a patience which is almost divine, and
there are teachers in the common schools to-day who
are only preserved to us because the age of translation
to heaven is past. There are unhappily others
who do not understand that this patient and laborious
seeking after the intellectual dialect of the
pupil is the only possible means of imparting instruction;
and thus it happens that some schools
are taught in a language which, while it is English,
is yet hardly more intelligible to the students than
would be Choctaw or the speech of Borrioboola-Gha.</p>

<p>In writing, the safest guide in this respect is
sound, homely common sense. Write without nonsense
in the way of self-consciousness or affectation.
Make it always a rule in general composition to
aim at the simple, average man; to write so that
the traditionally foolish wayfaring man need not err
therein. Remember that the aim is not to write
so that one may be understood, but to write so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>one cannot be misunderstood.</p>

<p>Absurdly enough, human vanity comes in here.
Untrained writers are apt to feel that they lower
themselves if they condescend to write for the intellectual
bourgeoisie. Many a clever young author
has come to grief because he could not bring himself
to use simple language lest it should seem that
he had not command of a more elaborate diction.
He has failed because he could not be willing to
address the ordinary reader lest he thereby might
appear to show that he had not the gift of speaking
to the learned. The great writers are men who
are free from this weakness; who are intent upon
making their message understood, and not upon
preserving a foolish appearance of superiority.
Shakespeare did not disdain to write for the London
apprentices brawling in the pit, or Homer to
sing for semi-barbarians half-drunken at the feast.
The masterpieces of literature which have been
addressed to the educated few are revered; those
which have been confessedly for the many have
been read and lived upon. To take as instances
two works written at about the same time: &ldquo;Paradise
Lost&rdquo; has been commended by critics and
admired by scholars; &ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo; has
been and is the favorite book with thousands. The
one has always been profoundly admired and the
other has been loved. I do not mean that this is
all that might be said of these classics, or that there
are no other considerations in determining their
worth, but they do serve to make more clear the
fact that to reach the general reader it is necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>to write for the general reader.</p>

<p>Speaking the language of the average man includes
also the confining of allusions to the range
of his probable knowledge, the taking for granted
nothing which he may not reasonably be supposed
to know. The temptation to show erudition is at
the elbow of every writer. When, near the beginning
of this lecture, I referred in an easy manner
to the Taj Mahal, I was instantly conscious that I
had used the comparison with a pleasant sense of
the air of superior knowledge which it might give.
However it may be with you, the probabilities are
that the ordinary reader would not be sufficiently
familiar with the elaborate ornamentation of that
wonder of the East to make my comparison to its
jewelled walls effective, and I left it only because
I wanted to use it here as an illustration.</p>

<p>It is no less needful to appeal to the average
emotional experiences of mankind in order to be
clear to the general reader. It must be remembered
that all art is based on the assumption of
a community of human feelings; in other words,
upon the theory that the fundamental emotions
are shared by all mankind. The more closely
a writer holds to common humanity, to common
human experience, the more wide will be the
range of his work, and the more clear will he
be in those very matters where clearness is most
difficult of attainment. The more subtile and remote
from ordinary human life are the emotions
and the passions to be portrayed, the more absolute
is the necessity of conveying them in terms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
simple and common experience. Analyze one of
the tragedies of Shakespeare or of the old Greek
dramatists, and you will find that its tremendous
effects are produced by means essentially simple.
By keeping always within the range of the sympathies
and feelings common to humanity, the masters
are able to make every stroke tell; and this method
is in the nature of things the only possible one.
Common humanity can comprehend only what it
has felt.</p>

<p>To gain Clearness it is necessary first to avoid
all vagueness of thought and all vagueness of expression.
It is needful to shun ambiguity of word
or of phrase, and that more subtle ambiguity
which may arise from ill-considered paragraphing,
from misproportion, or from bad arrangement of
the parts of a composition. It is no less important
to write with a constant remembrance of the
audience addressed; to use their language, and to
appeal to the emotions and experiences which are
likely to be common to the average individual of
the class for which one writes. Inexperienced
writers may make the mistake of supposing that
this is the rule by which mediocrity is to be
reached; but as a matter of fact these are the
principles upon which have been written the masterpieces
of the world.</p>

<h2><a name="VI" id="VI">VI</a></h2>

<p class="captitle">PRINCIPLES OF QUALITY CONTINUED</p>


<p>Force has been defined as the quality which
appeals to the emotions. Obviously, what we read
interests us or it does not. Persons who are conscious
that they are not qualified to judge of the
value of work, yet who are secretly convinced that
their judgment must be of value despite this fact,
are rather apt to take refuge in the annoying
phrase, &ldquo;I am no judge, but I can tell what I
like.&rdquo; Even this qualified statement is often conspicuously
untrue, but in so far as they really can
tell what they like, they are judges of the force
of what they read, their own emotions being the
standard; and in so far as they can tell why they
like or fail to like, they are judges also of the
means by which force has been secured, or for
want of which it has been lost.</p>

<p>We are accustomed to associate with the term
which is here used a signification more narrow and
more intense than that which is given to it in this
connection. Generally, when we speak of a piece
of literature as having force, we mean that it has
the power to move us to an unusual degree. We
think at once of the cyclone-swept pages of Carlyle,
of the penetrating mysteriousness of Kipling,
or of the fate-pervaded realism of Hardy; at least,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>of something moving and intense. In discussing
force as a quality of style, we must make the term
wide enough to cover whatever power a literary
composition has of arousing interest by what it
is. An accidental circumstance&mdash;the antiquity
of a book, the fact that it was written by a particular
person, the part which it has played in
an important event, and so on&mdash;might arouse a
certain sort of interest in it, but this would have
nothing to do with the force of the composition.
Those things which certain magazines bring out,
written by the notoriety of the hour,&mdash;the prize-fighter,
the woman who has made herself most conspicuous
in ways decent or indecent,&mdash;have not in
themselves anything that can be called Force in
the proper sense of the term. They may attract
much attention, but it is by accidental circumstances,
and not by their quality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The secret of Force,&rdquo; Mr. Wendell writes, &ldquo;is
connotation;&rdquo; and he goes on to exemplify this
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Compare these three simple statements: &ldquo;I found
him very agreeable one afternoon;&rdquo; &ldquo;I found him
very agreeable one wet afternoon;&rdquo; &ldquo;I found him
very agreeable one wet afternoon in a country house.&rdquo;
Now all that the word &ldquo;wet&rdquo; says is that the afternoon
was watery; but it clearly implies that it was an
afternoon when you would not care to be out of doors.
All that the words &ldquo;in a country house&rdquo; state is a
simple fact of locality; but they imply that you were
in a place where not to be out of doors was probably
a serious trial to the temper. So the last statement
as a whole, &ldquo;I found him very agreeable one wet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>afternoon in a country house,&rdquo; suggests, though it
does not state, that the person spoken of was one
whose charms could overcome a pretty bad temper.
At the same time it is a phrase which I fancy anybody
would admit to hold the attention more strongly than
either of its predecessors; and its superiority in force
lies not so much in the bare facts which it adds to the
first statement as in the thoughts and emotions it
suggests. Still again, take this sentence from one of
M. de Maupassant&rsquo;s stories: &ldquo;It was the 15th of
August&mdash;the feast of the Holy Virgin, and of the
Emperor Napoleon.&rdquo; He states only two facts about
the 15th of August, and these in the simplest of
words. Neither by itself would hold one&rsquo;s attention
enough to remain long in memory. But put them together;
think what the Holy Virgin means to Catholic
Europe, and what the Emperor Napoleon means
to those who are not subdued by the magic genius of
Bonaparte,&mdash;and you have a sentence that when mid-August
comes about will hover in your head. Yet
the force of this&mdash;so greatly superior to the force of
either statement by itself&mdash;lies not in what is actually
said, but wholly in what is implied, suggested, connoted,
in this sudden, unexpected antithesis.</p></div>

<p>The thing which the writer has caused the reader
to think&mdash;or even to suppose himself to think&mdash;is
sure to interest him. The dullest of bores
is absorbed in his own words, and in effect that
which the reader receives by suggestion is his own
thought. What is denoted is the word of the writer;
what is connoted is for the time being the thought
of the reader.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to see that Clearness is an aid
to Force; or, to put it more exactly, that a lack of
Clearness will interfere with Force. Yet the one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>is by no means essential to the other. The diction
of &ldquo;The Ordeal of Richard Feverel,&rdquo; that book so
strong that it wrings the heart almost like a fierce
personal sorrow, is in passages so obscure as to
have given rise to the rather cheap <i>mot</i> that the
novel would be successful if it were translated into
English. Almost any page of Carlyle might also
be cited in illustration; while that Clearness may
fail to secure Force is proved by the pellucidly
stupid lucubrations of an innumerable company of
authors whom nobody could fail to understand if
it were possible to keep awake to read them.</p>

<p>Connotation may be the result of various causes.
It may be produced by a swiftness and briskness
of motion which so awakens and quickens the mind
that the reader is aroused to thought, and seizes
each idea presented as if he had himself originated
it. It is this sort of force that we mean when we
speak of the vivacity or the brilliancy of a work.
The secret lies chiefly in passing quickly from one
significant point to another. This involves, it is apparent,
the power of selecting the significant, and
of bringing this out while avoiding the unessential.</p>

<p>The effectiveness of the sensational story depends
largely upon a quality closely allied to this,
although here it is a matter not so much of style
as of material. The tale which moves rapidly from
situation to situation, so that the reader seems to
share the adventures of the characters, often owes
as much to the swiftness of its progress as to the
nature of the story told. It owes more, as a general
thing, to the vividness with which the exciting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
situations are imagined and presented. The more
real a thing seems to the reader, the more suggestive
it must be to him, and the more likely is he
to share the sensations set down, so that for the
moment it seems as if he were actually experiencing
them. In other words, the more real the narrative,
the more suggestive it becomes.</p>

<p>One great means of producing this sense of reality
either in narrative or in any other kind of composition,
whether in the setting forth of thoughts,
or in the telling of events, is in making what is
written specific. The specific term is apt to be
more suggestive than the general from the fact
that it presents to the mind an idea which can be
grasped readily. When one reads that the Indians
are on the war-path and are ravaging the
country, one has a vague feeling of horror; but if
one is told that the Red Men have crossed the
bounds of Big Lick Reservation, have murdered
and scalped a settler named John Thing, have
burned his cabin, and carried off his wife and children,
there is no vagueness about it. The impression
becomes at once vivid and forceful in what it
denotes, and stirring in what it connotes.</p>

<p>It is from a misapplication of this fact that
modern fiction has fallen into that vice which has
been known as Realism&mdash;perhaps because it is less
real than any other sort of fiction ever devised. It
is apparently by a perception of the effectiveness
of the specific, that Realists have been led into the
error of believing in the effectiveness of the minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Before leaving the quality under discussion it is
well to say a word about what is called &ldquo;reserved
force.&rdquo; Our respect for a writer is always increased
by feeling that he might do more than he is doing.
We are led on by a desire to see what greater
things he will accomplish. The feeling in reading
an author who is evidently doing his utmost is not
unlike that felt in crossing a bridge which shakes
with the footfall. It may carry us over the stream,
but on the other hand it may break under us. I
once heard a lady explain her dislike for a certain
youth by saying: &ldquo;I never could endure a man
who is always doing his darnedest!&rdquo; The expression
is unhappily vulgar, but it does seem to me
to be humanly expressive. We do not like to feel
that we have come to the end of the resources of a
friend or of an author.</p>

<p>How then does a writer produce an impression
of reserved force? The phrase meets one in book
reviews, and to inexperienced writers is apt to convey
little but bewilderment. One way in which
the finished literary craftsman secures the impression
of reserved power is by deliberately making
the minor parts of his work weaker than those
more important. In other words, he gains the
effect of reserved strength by reserving strength.
Often it is well in the revision of a composition
to lessen the stress of expression in unimportant
passages; to soften down, as it were, all portions
except the high lights. The natural tendency of
every earnest writer is to express himself as vigorously
as possible, and in the first draft this is well,&mdash;provided
always that he has the self-control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and the skill so to modify in revision the less important
parts that the emphasis shall be properly
proportioned. Shading in literature is a matter
which it is not easy to explain without examples
much longer than it is possible to use here. It
must be learned by the study of masterpieces. It
is well to keep in mind, however, that it is oftener
the result of a clever softening of minor passages
than of a heavier emphasis upon important portions;
and above all that the secret of shading
and of reserved force as well is proportion. It is
rather comparative than absolute stress which is
effective. Vehemence is not vigor. Make up your
mind clearly what points you wish to bring out
most sharply; that is half of the process: then see
to it that the remaining parts of the composition
are kept subordinate to these; that is the rest of it.</p>

<p>Largely, too, is a sense of reserved force imparted
by smoothness and ease of style. A style
which is rough generally seems hard and labored.
To carry the reader forward easily seems to be to
carry him surely, and gives the impression that the
writer could go faster and farther if he but chose.</p>

<p>One of the secrets of smoothness is the art of
easy transition from one paragraph to another,
from one sentence to another, from one thought to
another. In Macaulay&rsquo;s essay on &ldquo;Machiavelli,&rdquo;
for instance, after speaking of the correspondence
of the Italian, the author continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is interesting and curious to recognize, in circumstances
which elude the notice of historians, &hellip;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>the fierce and haughty energy which gave dignity to
the eccentricities of Julius; the soft and graceful manners
which masked the insatiable ambition and the implacable
hatred of Cæsar Borgia.</p>

<p>We have mentioned Cæsar Borgia. It is impossible
not to pause for a moment on the name of a man
in whom the political morality of Italy was so strongly
personified, etc.</p></div>

<p>And so the essayist goes on to draw a comparison
between Cæsar Borgia and Machiavelli, which
he had of course intended from the first, but which
he has had the art to introduce as if it were a
sudden thought. The effect is as if the name of
Borgia had suggested the parallel; and not only
does this give an air of spontaneity, but it also
impresses the reader with a feeling of security in
the resources of the writer. If the mere mention
of a famous name can bring so much from his
mind, it is evident that that mind must be most
abundantly stored.</p>

<p>More subtle, and therein so much the more
admirable, is the art which links together the parts
of a composition simply by closeness of meaning.
To illustrate it would take too much room, but all
the great essayists afford examples, and it is in
them that this detail of literary skill may most
conveniently be studied.</p>

<p>Another matter closely connected with Force is
that of beginning and ending well. If the opening
sentence of a composition interest the reader he is
ready to go on, while an effective close leaves him
with a pleasant impression of what he has been
reading. In a composition divided into parts or
chapters, it is especially important to see to it that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>the separate portions end effectively. The general
verdict upon a book is largely made up of the
sum of impressions received from the endings of
sections. Here again the reader will find examples
in all the masters, but a few may be given. In a
vein almost familiar, but in entirely good taste,
Lowell begins his superb essay on Chaucer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Will it <i>do</i> to say anything more about Chaucer?
Can any one hope to say anything, not new but even
fresh, on a topic so well worn?</p></div>

<p>This very statement of the difficulty provokes
the reader to go on to see how that difficulty is
overcome.</p>

<p>In somewhat the same vein is Saintsbury&rsquo;s beginning
of his paper on Hogg:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;What on earth,&rdquo; it was once asked, &ldquo;will you
make of Hogg?&rdquo; I think that there is something to
to be made of Hogg, and that it is something worth
making.</p></div>

<p>Or take the opening of Stevenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gossip on
Romance:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In anything fit to be called by the name of reading,
the process itself should be absorbing and voluptuous;
we should gloat over a book, be rapt clean out
of ourselves, and rise from the perusal, our minds
filled with the busiest, kaleidoscopic dance of images,
incapable of sleep or continuous thought.</p></div>

<p>The intoxication of the ideal which this gives us
is so full of suggestion, it brings up so vividly the
best delights that have marked our reading, that
our minds are awake and alert from the start. We
are not only ready but eager to go forward under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>guidance of an author who has so charming a conception
of what sort of a treat he should strive to
give the reader.</p>

<p>Endings are if possible even more important,
and they are carefully studied by masters of style.
Take this conclusion of Lowell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Abraham Lincoln:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Never was funeral panegyric so eloquent as the silent
looks of sympathy which strangers exchanged as
they met that day. Their common manhood had lost
a kinsman.</p></div>

<p>One puts down the book with that suggestively
solemn phrase sounding on in the brain like the
reverberation when a great bell ceases its knell for
a hero.</p>

<p>Or re-read the brief description of the tombstone
of Hester Prynne, which closes &ldquo;The Scarlet
Letter,&rdquo; and which ends with a phrase so haunting:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It bore a device, a herald&rsquo;s wording of which
might serve for a motto and brief description of our
now concluded legend, so sombre is it, and relieved
only by one ever-glowing point of light gloomier than
the shadow: &ldquo;<span class="smcap">On a field, sable, the letter A,
gules</span>.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Or take the wonderful ending of that chapter
in &ldquo;Vanity Fair&rdquo; which gives a description of
Waterloo, and in a single sentence shows its relation
to the story and brings the tale into closest
connection with all of history and all of human
life:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The darkness came down on field and city, and
Amelia was praying for George, who was lying on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>face, dead, with a bullet through his heart.</p></div>

<p>It is of course unnecessary to go on with examples.
The student can find them abundantly
for himself. The point is that in his own work he
shall remember to look carefully to this detail,
since there is no single matter more closely connected
with the effect of a composition.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>
<p>It is evident that the power to interest and to
arouse by suggestion must depend largely upon the
extent to which the writer is able to enter into the
reader&rsquo;s mood. In other words, that writer is most
effectively suggestive who is most completely and
practically sympathetic. The foundation of whatever
is really vital must be in the genuine feeling
and the actual experience of the author. This experience,
it is true, may be actual in the imagination
only, but it must have been felt as a reality.
The secret of sympathy is in the well-known line
of Sidney:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>&ldquo;Fool,&rdquo; said my muse to me, &ldquo;look in thy heart and write!&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">It is idle to hope to hold any reader, or to move
him strongly, unless we are really interested ourselves;
and it is equally impossible to touch him if
there be any suspicion on his part that we are not
dealing with him with perfect frankness. What
we write must be real to us, and it must be told
with perfect frankness, if we are to reach the hearts
of those we address.</p>

<p>There is perhaps no advice more wholesome for
young writers than that they confine themselves
absolutely to their own experience whenever it is in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
any way possible. If an illustration is to be given,
a figure employed, a comparison used, let the illustration,
the figure, the comparison be found in the
things of which the writer has actual knowledge.
It is not alone that this will insure a vitality which
is hardly to be imparted to anything taken at second
hand, but, what is of more importance, it will
also make it at least more probable that the writer
keeps within the experiences of his readers. Of
the things which one has actually seen and felt, it
is easy to judge how far they are usual; and the
more closely a writer confines himself to usual
things, the more forceful his style is likely to be.</p>

<p>A remark of Lowell&rsquo;s contains by implication a
hint which we shall do well to notice here.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>What he [Dryden] valued above all things was
force, though in his haste he is willing to make shift
with its counterfeit, effect.&mdash;<i>Dryden.</i></p></div>

<p>The word &ldquo;force&rdquo; is here used in the sense of
vigor and lasting power, its meaning being somewhat
more limited than that in which we are using
it as a technical term. It is the same in essentials,
however, and the distinction which is brought
out in the sentence quoted is one not to be overlooked.
Effect is the transient, whereas force is
the permanent: effect startles, force holds; effect
is the sham, force the true. The worst type of
style which sacrifices force to effect is the sensational
novel, or the so-called &ldquo;breezy&rdquo; journalism.
To startle, to shock, to produce a sensation, at
whatever sacrifice of probability, of reason, or of
good taste,&mdash;the thing is unfortunately too well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>known to need particularization.</p>

<p>An effeminate form of striving for effect is what
is known as &ldquo;fine writing.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fine writing&rdquo; is
a fault so gross that it is not necessary to waste
many words on it. It need only be said that there
is no more certain indication of a hopelessly diseased
literary taste, or of a hopelessly depraved
habit of composition, than this absurdly antiquated
verbal vice. Of course no writer who produces
literature is guilty of it, but I somewhere have
picked up an example which so happily illustrates
all that could be said on the subject that
I cannot forbear to quote it. It is from a novel
called &ldquo;Barabbas,&rdquo; by Miss Marie Corelli, and
is part of the description of the appearance of
Christ before Pontius Pilate. Water having been
brought, Pilate, according to Miss Corelli, thus
proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Slowly lowering his hands, he dipped them in the
shining bowl, rinsing them over and over again in
the clear, cold element, which sparkled in its polished
receptacle like an opal against the fire.</p></div>

<p>The Bible finds it possible to say all of this that
is necessary in the words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Pilate took water, and washed his hands.</p></div>

<p>Miss Corelli&rsquo;s ingenuity in expanding and distorting
has won its reward,&mdash;her novel has been
warmly commended by Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>Even really great writers are not always free
from this fault, although here it is apt to be
from some mixture of humorous intent that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
fall into it. Instead of &ldquo;she hardened her heart,&rdquo;
George Meredith writes, in one of those irritating
sentences which are too frequent in his books,
and which affect one like freckles on the face of
a goddess, &ldquo;She turned her inward flutterer to
steel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Force, then, depends upon suggestion, and this
is secured by sincerity, by appeals to human experiences
common to all, by freedom from affectations,
and by attention to such details as proper
beginnings and endings. Other means of securing
it we shall deal with later. Here it is enough to
insist again that the great secret of Force lies in
earnestness, sincerity, and sympathy.</p>

<p>To pass from Force to Elegance is to advance
from the more subtle to the most subtle. It is not
difficult to be definite in speaking of Clearness; it
is less easy in discussing Force; while, at the very
outset of the consideration of Elegance, we are met
by the fact that it is hardly possible even to define
this third principle of quality. Indeed, it is
perhaps not too much to say that nobody is even
fully satisfied with this name for the æsthetic quality.
&ldquo;Elegance&rdquo; is the term which is coming to
be accepted as, on the whole, the most convenient
and satisfactory offered; but I suppose that nobody
would feel inclined to insist strongly upon
this especial word. Mr. Wendell writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Elegance is that distinguishing quality of style that
pleases the taste; &hellip; the æsthetic quality of style,
that subtle something in a work of literary art which
makes us feel delight in workmanship. Beauty, some
call it; charm, others; others still, grace, ease, finish,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>mastery.</p></div>

<p>The name does not much matter; the quality
matters greatly. It is this more than all else
that gives lasting value to literature. There is in
style an indefinable power of reaching the emotions
of the reader which is beyond the effect of what
is actually said, even beyond the effect of what is
suggested. The quality which makes intelligible
actual statement is Clearness; that which brings
home to the reader the wealth of suggestion which
may lie behind what is directly said is Force; while
beyond both is that quality of style which conveys
the intangible, which carries to the mind of
the reader emotions too delicate to be confined
in words, which touches and arouses as fineness
of color or line or sound moves us in painting or
sculpture or music. This is what we mean by Elegance.
It is the æsthetic effect produced purely
by the literary form; by the perfection of the relation
between the end sought and the means employed;
by the complete mastery of technique, and
the employment of all the resources of art for the
embodiment of the imaginative in literary form.</p>

<p>I am aware that my definition may make the
matter less clear rather than more plain, but the
thing is too elusive to be caught in the trap of
a simple definition. Elegance is the quality in
which the imagination most directly makes itself
manifest. It is the most tangible proof that a
writer possesses that power which at the start
we spoke of as inborn and incommunicable. As
a matter of workmanship, and so far as it may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>learned, Elegance is chiefly the ability to convey in
words the mood of the writer. It depends largely
upon an exquisite sensitiveness to the indirect
effect of words and of word-combination. It is
to be cultivated by training the mind to consider
always the value of terms in their connotation; to
weigh them not only by their direct meaning, but
by their association, and by the ideas and ideals
and emotions which they bring to the mind; and
by developing taste in literary construction. To
write with Elegance, it is also necessary to keep in
mind the effect upon the reader of the emotional
word-color. The suggestions of words are dependent
in part upon the mere vocal effect of the
sounds producing them, upon the harmony of the
sentence, the tone-value and cadence of clause and
paragraph. All these things are elements which
must be considered. Completely to master all
these, so as to work upon the mind and imagination
of the reader at will, is of course within the
power of the great imagination only; but every
student may advance toward it.</p>

<p>We are none of us able satisfactorily to define
beauty, or to explain the pleasure which it excites;
yet there is no one of us who has not recognized
both. Why a curve is more pleasing to the eye than
a straight line may be too deep a question; but none
the less may one safely appeal to the universal experience
that there are certain lines, certain forms,
certain colors, certain sounds which give us pleasure.
With equal assurance may one appeal to the
universal instinct which is gratified by the adaptation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>of ends to means; to the innate human sense
of the rightness of what is fitting; the constant
pleasure in order, in appropriateness, in harmony.
It is this instinct, this sense, this pleasure, which
underlies the sensitiveness of the mind to what we
call Elegance in composition.</p>

<p>The quality which we are discussing is, more than
any other, dependent upon the personal taste and
culture of the writer. The thing to be said to the
student is perhaps this: &ldquo;Elegance is the result
of a keen and acutely imaginative perception of
the fitness of things, and of a quick appreciation
of beauty, with the power to convey both by a
delicate adaptation of literary means to literary
effects.&rdquo; A keen and acute perception of the fitness
of things can only be acquired by the development
of the taste. This is an affair of culture
in its broadest sense, and it is hardly possible to
separate here the question of literary excellence
from that of general development. The study of
the masterpieces of literature&mdash;always with earnestness
and with sympathy&mdash;is the most direct
means of improving a sensitiveness to literary fitness
and to literary beauty. The adaptation of
means to ends we shall go on considering throughout
these talks; and now, as always, it is necessary
to remember that the way to learn to write is to
write. The way to achieve Elegance is to labor
for it with that persistence which is in itself the
best compensation which Heaven has bestowed
upon man for all other boons denied. &ldquo;Persistence,
persistence, and persistence&rdquo; is the motto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
which the student must engrave on his heart.</p>

<p>There will always remain the personal equation.
No student can afford to close his eyes to the fact
that all men are born intellectually unequal. To
one has Nature given gifts of appreciation, of apprehension,
and of expression, while from another
she has withheld them. This personal difference
affects all work, and it affects work more and
more strongly as we draw nearer to that quality
in literature which is incommunicable. Steadily,
since the beginning of these talks, have we been
advancing toward those fields of composition where
comes into play that power which is the gift of the
gods only; that imaginative essence which some
men are dowered with at birth, and which some
go seeking their whole lives through with insistence
pathetically vain. The one thing important
is, that the student not only accept his individual
limitations, but that he do not stop short of them.
It is necessary to realize that one has not genius,
and then to work as if one had; and it is amazing
how much may be done in this way. Nature, for
instance, plainly intended that Matthew Arnold
should not write elegant prose, and she absolutely
forbade him to write poetry, yet he succeeded in
doing both. The earnest student of literary art
should resolutely refuse to be satisfied with any
thing short of the miracle of the impossible, and
haply so he may sometimes attain to it.</p>

<p class="captitle">MEANS AND EFFECTS</p>


<p>When the student has come to have a clear idea
of what is to be sought in composition, he naturally
goes on to inquire by what means a writer can
gain the ends desired. It has been shown that
there are certain principles which govern the mechanical
structure of language, and also that there
are as well principles which have to do with the
quality of what is written. The next step is to examine
the especial means which are at the command
of the worker, and what effects may be secured by
the use of given means.</p>

<p>It has already been said and insisted upon that
it is necessary to know accurately what effect the
writer desires to produce; and it is to be added
that it is especially needful to realize from the start
what is to be the conclusion of a work, great or
small. The end of a composition is its consummation,
the climax toward which all else conducts the
reader, the ultimate effect to which all other effects
are subordinate. The writer who sets out to go nowhere
in particular, it has been said, is little likely
to arrive anywhere. It is also to be remembered
that, unless he is clearly aware what is to be his
strongest point, he is not in a position to make all
other parts properly subordinate to this,&mdash;to secure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>that careful proportion of emphasis which is one of
the great essentials of all good work in whatever
province of art.</p>

<p>Before he begins to write, the writer must make
up his mind how he intends to end. He may, it is
true, modify to some extent the first idea of the
form in which this climax of his work is to be put,
but it is safe to lay down as a general rule that
he shall not essentially alter it. Whether one sits
down to write a novel, a tale, an essay, an editorial,
or a simple paragraph, let him know at least
what the conclusion is to be, whether he is aware
of the steps by which he is to reach this or not.
The minor points may be thought up as one proceeds,
but the end, which is in a manner the reason
of the existence of the whole, must be clear
in the mind of the writer from the very start.</p>

<p>It is this thing which Mr. Walter Pater means
when he speaks of&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>That architectural conception of a work which
foresees the end from the beginning, and never loses
sight of it, and in every part is conscious of all the
rest, till the very last sentence does but, with undiminished
vigor, unfold and justify the first.</p></div>

<p>The conclusion being well defined in the writer&rsquo;s
thought, the next thing to be determined is the
point of view. The point of view is to any composition
what the hypothesis is to a proposition
in geometry. It is the assumption of personality
and of attitude which is presupposed from the start,
and which must be rigidly maintained to the end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>If a writer is describing a landscape, he is
obliged to fix in his own mind the point from which
he is to consider that landscape as being seen,&mdash;whether
near or remote, from hill or plain, from a
bridge, a window, or it may be from the deck of a
vessel. If he hopes to produce an impression which
shall be clear, or to bring up vividly in the mind of
the reader the thing described, he must not forget
where the reader is supposed to be placed. If at
the start he writes as if the view were remote, and
then forgets and speaks of it as if it were near at
hand, he destroys the consistency of the work and
makes all ineffectual.</p>

<p>Another easily appreciated illustration is to be
found in novels which are written in the form of
an autobiography. Since the story is supposed to
be narrated by one of the characters, it follows
that nothing should be told which that person could
not know. The introduction of scenes at which he
could not have been present, of talk which he could
not have heard, of thoughts which he had no means
of discovering, completely dispels the illusion. If
these things must be used, care must be taken to
show how the narrator came to know them; since
otherwise the hypothesis with which the author
started is violated by the alteration of the point of
view. The reader may or may not realize why the
story loses its effect of reality, but he cannot fail
to feel that it does lose it.</p>

<p>The same principle applies to everything that is
written, even to the most trivial paragraph. Consciously
or unconsciously, the writer at the start
assumes a certain mental attitude toward the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>of which he writes, and this attitude he must
carefully preserve. Of course the point of view
may be progressive, as when one describes the
scenery as viewed from a car window or shows
the change of opinion; but in this case the motion
is part of the original hypothesis. The first assumption
must be adhered to, since to change the
point of view is to break faith with the reader,
and to break faith is to lose his confidence.</p>

<p>The philosophy of the matter is simple and obvious
enough. It is the aim to induce the reader to
submit, for the time being, his personality to that
of the writer; to induce him to see with the eyes of
the author, and to think with the author&rsquo;s mind.
The slightest jar may destroy all illusion; the
least difficulty may make the reader assert the
supremacy of his own individuality. If even unconsciously
his judgment is offended, his own consciousness
is sure to assert itself, and he gives himself
up no longer.</p>

<p>In practical work, the secret of preserving one
mental attitude is largely that of being clearly
aware of it. This detail of composition is perhaps
most easily understood in its application to description
or narration, but it must be as clearly realized
in all composition. It is of high importance to
determine beforehand what is the attitude of the
writer both toward the subject and toward the
reader addressed. The effect of a failure to observe
this is found in a great many letters, and,
perhaps I may be pardoned if I add, especially in
feminine letters. The mind of woman is so flexible,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>so versatile, so capable of seeing many sides to
a subject which to the duller masculine intellect
seems to have but one, that it not infrequently
happens that in a single page of a woman&rsquo;s letter
there will be half a dozen points of view, or even
that seeming impossibility of two or three points of
view at once.</p>

<p>Often the application of this principle is so subtle
that the tyro is entirely at a loss to know what
is the matter with his sentence. Take these examples:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The crowd turns, departs, disintegrates.</p>

<p>I noticed that the hat was of soft felt, and one might
easily guess that it had been bought at a bargain sale.
It lent a comfortable sense of satisfaction to its owner,
and suggested to him the idea of going to church.</p></div>

<p>In the former, the writer&rsquo;s point of view is that
of one looking out of a window at a crowd, and it
is proper that he should say &ldquo;turns, departs;&rdquo; but
after the crowd has departed he cannot see whether
it disintegrates or not. If he should say, &ldquo;Turns,
disintegrates, departs,&rdquo; one could find no fault. In
the second example, the point of view is at first
that of an observer who sees the hat on the head of
a stranger; then, without warning, it is shifted to
the mind of any observer,&mdash;&ldquo;one,&rdquo;&mdash;and then, in
a twinkling, to the thought of the wearer himself,
which has been by the hat turned to the idea of
going to church.</p>

<p>We shall have to do later with the point of view
in its application to the various sorts of composition.
Here it is enough to add the warning to inexperienced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>writers: Do not write to discover what you
think, or how you feel about a subject. These
questions are to be settled before writing is begun.
In half the themes which I read, it is apparent that
the writer has been going ahead in a sort of forlorn
hope of ultimately learning his own opinions.
To be in doubt when one begins, either of where
one is bound or of how the attempt to get there is
to be made, is as fatal in writing as in horse-racing.
There is a good deal of what might be called the
June-bug style of composition. Just as a beetle
bangs his clumsy thick head against a window or a
netting in hope that he may chance to strike a place
where he can get through to the lamp within, so
the June-bug writer goes banging absurdly down
his page, bumping against any obstacle, trusting
to fate and the chapter of accidents to show somewhere
and somehow a way through. The man who
has learned to write does not begin until he has
an idea what his way through is to be. This being
clear in his mind, he goes consistently toward it,
and his consistency is what is called keeping the
point of view.</p>

<p>The point of view being selected, it is often necessary
to give the reader a clue to it. Sometimes
it is needful to use no inconsiderable amount of
skill to bring him to accept it. The well-trained
reader always endeavors to put himself into complete
sympathy with an author. The author is
bound to make this as easy as possible, and even,
if may be, to render it inevitable, to the end that
the reader shall be forced to share the outlook of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>the writer, whether with conscious willingness or
not. In obvious matters, like descriptions, the simple
device of naming the point of view is enough.
When Keats begins a poem,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I stood tiptoe upon a little hill,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">he gives the point of view. So does Spenser when
he opens the &ldquo;Faerie Queene:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A gentle knight was pricking on the plain.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Equally is Lowell giving the point of view in the
opening of the essay on Chaucer, already quoted:
&ldquo;Will it <i>do</i> to say anything more about Chaucer?&rdquo;
Here he at once puts the reader into the attitude
of examining with fresh attention a subject which
has been greatly discussed; by implication he intimates
that there is still enough wheat in the often-threshed
straw to make it worth while once more
to turn it over. With equal skill and felicity he
puts the reader into the mood in which he writes
of Carlyle by the first sentence of another essay:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A feeling of comical sadness is likely to come over
the mind of any middle-aged man who sets himself to
recollecting the names of the authors that have been
famous, and the number of contemporary immortalities
whose end he has seen since coming to manhood.</p></div>

<p>The reader perceives at once that the subject
which is to be treated is to be regarded as of less
assured permanence of importance than has been
sometimes held. Evidently Lowell would not allude
to the many transient so-called immortalities
if he had not at least a suspicion that the contemporary
reputation of Carlyle is likely to be lessened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
by time. The key-note is struck, and what follows
is governed by it.</p>

<p>The secret of holding the reader to the point of
view consists largely of keeping strictly to it in
writing. If the author does not change his position,
the reader is unconsciously drawn to it. There
is a persuasive power in mere persistency which is
recognized by any one who has had to do with an
obstinate person, and this power tells in literature
as fully as in domestic life.</p>

<p>We come next to figurative language, so called;
and at this point it used to be the fashion to overwhelm
the student with a list of dreadful names
which was in itself enough to paralyze the mental
processes, and to discourage at once and forever all
aspiration after excellence. The appalling words
<i>synecdoche</i>, <i>metonymy</i>, <i>antonomasia</i>, <i>asyndeton</i>,
<i>anacolouthon</i>, <i>parrhesia</i>, <i>onomatopoeia</i>, and the
rest, seemed to fascinate the soul of writers on
composition as completely as they dazed and stupefied
the understanding of the unhappy student.
Pedants have amused themselves by darkening wisdom
with words without knowledge, until it is all
but impossible to come at anything practical in the
old-fashioned books,&mdash;which were invariably called
&ldquo;treatises.&rdquo; It has been found that this is idle,
and for the most part it has been laid aside. A
few terms are for convenience still used, but in
these days the effort, instead of being to give learned
and pompous-sounding treatises on the art of composition,
is if possible to set down what will assist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the student in learning literary expression.</p>

<p>One of the first literary devices of which man&rsquo;s
mind availed itself in its efforts to communicate
ideas, was the use of figures. The thought moves
naturally from the near to the remote, and from
that which is known to that which is unknown. If
we attempt to describe or explain a thing, we instinctively
compare it to something which is familiar.
&ldquo;It is like this,&rdquo; we say; &ldquo;it is similar to
that thing which you know.&rdquo; It has often been
remarked that all language is full of what Trench
happily calls the fossil remains of metaphors,&mdash;words
which were once used to convey an idea by
comparing it to something known, but of which
the figurative force is now forgotten. It is hardly
necessary to give examples, because every student
has had his attention called to this class of words;
but their number illustrates how natural comparisons
are, and how constantly they are called to aid
expression.</p>

<p>To comparison it is customary to give two names,
according as the likeness is stated explicitly or is
implied. If a writer says, &ldquo;The officer followed
his victim like a sleuth-hound,&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase which
used to come into all the detective stories,&mdash;he
makes an explicit comparison between the officer
and a hound. If he writes, &ldquo;The sleuth-hound of
justice followed the track of his prey,&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase
still to be met with in newspapers of a certain class,&mdash;the
comparison is the same, but it is assumed
instead of being explicitly stated. To the expressed
comparison is given the name &ldquo;simile;&rdquo; to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the comparison assumed, the name &ldquo;metaphor.&rdquo; It
is of no great practical importance&mdash;unless in the
line of encouraging carefulness in the discrimination
of words&mdash;whether the distinction of names
is carefully observed or not, but it is of some convenience
in study.</p>

<p>The object of using figures is to add Clearness,
or Force, or Elegance&mdash;or all of these&mdash;to the
presentation of an idea. Constantly it happens
that, by declaring that an unknown thing is like
some known thing, the writer enables the reader to
form an idea of it as it is. When in Job we read
the beautiful simile, &ldquo;My days are swifter than a
weaver&rsquo;s shuttle,&rdquo; we are impressed by the passage
of life with a vividness which could not be
secured by any mere assertion, no matter how
strong. The physical fact is so easily grasped that
it makes more clear the intellectual reflection. In
the same wonderful poem&mdash;and no one studying
literature either for profit or for pleasure can afford
to neglect the book of Job&mdash;there are beautiful
figures enough to teach the art of using them were
it otherwise forgotten. &ldquo;Man is born unto trouble,
as the sparks fly upward;&rdquo; &ldquo;I caused the widow&rsquo;s
heart to sing for joy;&rdquo; &ldquo;The house appointed for
all living;&rdquo; &ldquo;He maketh the deep to boil like a
pot;&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full
age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season,&rdquo;&mdash;it
is impossible not to see how in every
case the thought is made more clear by the comparison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>It is evident, too, that in each case cited the expression
has gained not only in Clearness but in
Force. The moment a likeness is suggested, the
mind of the reader is led to make the comparison,
and is thus alive and alert; while in each case the
figure suggests far more than any bare statement
of fact. Since the secret of Force lies in connotation,
in the suggestiveness which leads the mind
onward into the mood so that it seems to itself to
originate the ideas which are really given to it
directly or indirectly by the author, it follows that
in the use of figures is one of the most effectual
means of securing this quality. Job says, &ldquo;My
days are swifter than a weaver&rsquo;s shuttle,&rdquo; and with
the plain statement of the brevity of life come suggestions
of the inevitableness of this brevity; we
seem to see man tossed by the hand of the unseen,
as a shuttle is thrown by the hand of the weaver,
flung to and fro without power to stay or to resist.
The whole despairing mood of the afflicted patriarch
is summed up in the single simile. To come
nearer to our own times, take that simile which is
perhaps the most beautiful in English literature
outside of Shakespeare:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fair as a star when only one<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is shining in the sky.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">What is suggested is all the serenity of the eventide;
the hush which comes between the daylight
and the dark; the sense of peace; that feeling that
a mystery is being wrought before our very eyes,
when out of the faintly rose-purple haze of the sky
throbs into radiance the first star. There is, too,
that sense of restfulness that belongs to the twilight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
coolness, and, in some undefinable way, an
idea of purity and innocence too high and too subtle
to be defined. The gain in Force from such
richness of suggestion is evident.</p>

<p>Even more closely than with Clearness or Force
is the use of figures connected with Elegance. More
than any other means at the disposal of the writer
does this help to establish the mood which the
author desires to share with his reader. More, perhaps,
than any other means may figures be moulded
to manifold uses, and thus they have large share in
that adaptation of the means to an end, in which,
as has been said, lies the secret of Elegance.</p>

<p>The proper use of figures is a thing which it is
of the utmost importance for the student to master
thoroughly; and I have ventured to set down a few
rules which may be useful in practical work:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Never use a figure without a definite purpose,
and never simply for its own sake.</p>

<p>2. Never subordinate sense to figure.</p>

<p>3. Make all figures easily comprehensible.</p>

<p>4. Never make a comparison without realizing
fully what it is.</p>

<p>5. Never push a figure too far.</p>

<p>The reason for giving the first rule is, that so
many young writers&mdash;I say young writers as a
matter of courtesy, since there are plenty of old
ones of whom it is no less true!&mdash;are given to the
fault of piling up figures in much the same way
that a tasteless milliner sometimes puts on her
bonnets all the artificial flowers that can be made
to stick to them, or as a stupid architect kills the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
design of a building by overloading it with ornaments.
Figures exist for the style, and not the
style for the figures; and from this follows not
only the first rule, but the second also. To make
the figure of more importance than the thing which
it is to illustrate or to reinforce is to exalt the servant
above the master.</p>

<p>The third rule is justified by the fact that figures
are used to increase the lucidity of style, and
that in a manner all comparisons are to be looked
upon as in the nature of illustrations. It follows
that they must, in order to fulfill their function, be
easily understood themselves. Examine this passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">&hellip; The Wandering Jew has seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men come and go as the fixed Pyramids<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have seen even the steadfast polar star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shift in its place.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">To see any force in this, it is necessary to be aware
that, since the Pyramids were built, the North Star
has been altered in the precession of the equinoxes.
A writer has no right to appeal to such special
knowledge. This is one of the reasons why there
are so few of the discoveries of modern science,
rich and varied as they are, which can effectively
be used in simile. The allusions would not be
commonly understood. Another reason, equally
potent, is that in general the connotation of scientific
facts is too practical and uninspiring to add
to the interest of poetic or imaginative themes. In
old days it was the fashion for minor poets to go
as far afield as possible for similes, which were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>dragged into verse as a Comanche Indian drags
into camp his captives. Foot-notes were generously
provided for the enlightenment of the reader, and
nobody seemed to see the absurdity of illustrating
a thought by a figure so obscure that it had
itself to be explained. The tropes of the minor
poets of the last century remind one of the remark
of the Scotch goodwife about a learnedly obscure
commentary on the Scriptures: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a braw wise
book, na dout; an&rsquo; the Bible does explain it wonderfu&rsquo;.&rdquo;
If a writer will hold to his own experience
for his similes, he will have little difficulty in
deciding what is likely to be readily understood by
the general reader; and if he will remember that,
provided that there be nothing vulgar or ludicrous
or commonplace in its suggestion, the more homely
an allusion the more effective it is likely to be, he
cannot go far wrong.</p>

<p>The rule never to make a comparison without
realizing fully what it is should be regarded as
being as binding as a moral precept. If this be
obeyed, there is no danger of the production of
that hybrid microbe with which the pages of sensational
fiction swarm, which is known as the mixed
metaphor. I took up in the smoking-room of a
steamer not long ago a novel called &ldquo;Half a Million
of Money,&rdquo; by Miss Amelia B. Edwards. I
opened to a page on which was this sentence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Trefalden cast a hasty glance about the room, as if
looking for some weapon wherewith to slake the hatred
that glittered in his eye.&mdash;Chap. xciv.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">I give carefully the origin of this, since it seems
like an absurd mock simile manufactured for the
occasion. If the author had felt the force of the
word &ldquo;slake,&rdquo; and how it involves the idea of
thirst, she could not have coupled it with &ldquo;weapon&rdquo;
or with &ldquo;glittered in his eye.&rdquo; A thirst which is
slaked with a sword and glitters in the eye needs
only to be realized to be cast aside.</p>

<p>Goethe, in speaking of Klopstock, once said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>An ode occurs to me where he makes the German
muse run a race with the British; and indeed, when
one thinks what a picture it is, where the girls run one
against the other, throwing about their legs, and kicking
up the dust, one must assume that the good Klopstock
did not really have before his eyes such pictures
as he wrote, else he could not possibly have made
such mistakes.&mdash;<i>Conversations of Goethe</i>, November 9,
1824.</p></div>

<p>Of these lines of Montgomery,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The soul aspiring pants its source to mount,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As streams meander level to their fount,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Macaulay observes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We take this to be, on the whole, the worst similitude
in the world. In the first place, no stream meanders
or can possibly meander level with the fount. In
the next place, if streams did meander level with their
founts, no two notions can be less like each other than
that of meandering level and mounting upward.&mdash;Cited
in Bartlett&rsquo;s <i>Familiar Quotations</i>.</p></div>

<p>It would be easy and it would be amusing to
go on with examples of mixed figures and figures
which are ineffective, but the point hardly needs
further illustration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Pushing a figure too far is a fault less common
in these days than it has been at some periods of
our literary history when fashions in writing were
more ornate than at present. If a writer realizes
what a simile means, he is not likely to fall into
this error. It is when he introduces a figure for
the sake of the figure, and not for the purpose of
strengthening or making more clear what he is
saying, that this fault occurs.</p>

<p>These lines of Cowper may serve as an example:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Man is a harp, whose chords elude the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each yielding harmony disposed aright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The screws reversed (a task which, if He please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God in a moment executes with ease),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten thousand thousand strings at once go loose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost, till He tune them, all their power and use.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">If this stopped with the second line, it might do
well enough; but when the attention is forced to
the consideration of the mechanical details of the
harp, and the image of ten thousand thousand
strings and a corresponding number of screws, and
the notion applied to a man bereft of his wits, the
idea becomes absurd, and whatever value the figure
might have is entirely lost.</p>

<p>A clear realization of what he is doing will also
prevent the writer from mingling figure and fact.
&ldquo;He was the guardian genius of Ireland, and had
served with eloquence and credit in legislative
halls,&rdquo; could hardly have been written by one who
felt clearly the meaning and significance of the figure.
To realize how a guardian genius would look
in legislative halls would have brought him at once
to his senses. It is always necessary to have sharply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>defined in the brain whatever one is saying, but
this is especially true of any use of language which
invites the reader to loose his grasp upon absolute,
literal fact.</p>

<p>The difference between simile and metaphor is
one which need not be pressed very sharply. It is
to be observed that as writing becomes more excited
or impassioned there is less need of insisting
upon formalities; so that as the writer warms his
readers, he may assume a likeness instead of explicitly
stating it. At the beginning of a passage it
may be better to say, &ldquo;Napoleon swept like a tempest
over Europe,&rdquo; whereas later, the reader having
become interested in the theme, it is fitting to
write, &ldquo;Napoleon, the tempest which was sweeping
over Europe.&rdquo; There is probably no better rule
than for the writer to do that which at the moment
seems to him most natural, and then in revision to
see if it strikes him as it did when he wrote it.</p>

<p>Personification may be conveniently regarded as
classed with simile and metaphor. It is somewhat
out of fashion, but if it is used it is to be governed
by the rules given above. One who realizes what
he is saying in the phrase, &ldquo;Hope told a flattering
tale,&rdquo;&mdash;who sees that he is representing Hope as
a beautiful and seductive being,&mdash;is not likely to
go on to add, &ldquo;but this hope was founded upon
a delusion,&rdquo; because he cannot conceive a young
nymph or goddess as being founded upon anything.
He will naturally and without effort carry out the
figure, and say, &ldquo;but she beguiled us;&rdquo; or, &ldquo;but
all her flatteries were delusions.&rdquo; The truth is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>that the mind will generally go in the right direction
if it is given a fair chance. It is only when
we hamper it with rules not understood, when we
force it to go in paths which we suppose to be laid
out by conventions, or when we endeavor to make
it pace according to our vanity, that it goes astray.
Be natural in the use of figures, and you will seldom
be wrong.</p>

<p class="captitle">MEANS AND EFFECTS CONTINUED</p>


<p>Few means of literary effect are more subtle
than Variety. It must pervade all parts of a composition,
yet it is to be perceived only by its effects.
Its absence is at once noted, and at once destroys
the beauty and attractiveness of any work; yet to
define Variety is as difficult as to tell how it is to
be secured. Stevenson gives a rule as wise as it
is hard to follow: &ldquo;The one rule is to be infinitely
various.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The need of variety in the use of words is evident.
The fault of repetition is sufficiently obvious,
yet it is very easily committed. The fact that
a sentence has been written in a given form often
makes that seem the only correct way of expression.
No one but a thoroughly trained writer can be as
sensitive to errors in his own work as to mistakes
in the writings of others; and so it happens that
unless one is very careful the same word may appear
two or three times in a passage where synonyms
would be better than the repetition. That
richness in synonyms which is one of the finest
characteristics of English does away with any necessary
difficulty in attaining variety in diction.
In writing, and yet more in revising, the value and
force of synonymous terms cannot be too constantly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>kept in mind. A knowledge of these, with that cardinal
virtue of writers, the dictionary-habit, should
carry any student triumphantly past all dangers of
monotony in words.</p>

<p>One caution should perhaps be added: Do not
be afraid to repeat a word as often as is really
necessary. I quoted in an earlier chapter a sentence
from Lowell which illustrates what I mean:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The soil out of which such men as he are made is
good to be born on, good to live on, good to die for
and be buried in.</p></div>

<p>Or notice the repetition of &ldquo;man&rdquo; and of &ldquo;department&rdquo;
in this from Macaulay:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A man possessed of splendid talents, which he often
abused, and of sound judgment, the admonitions of
which he often neglected; a man who succeeded only
in an inferior department of his art, but who in that
department succeeded preëminently.&mdash;<i>On John Dryden.</i></p></div>

<p class="noindent">Here the judicious repetition of the subject holds
the whole closely together, and saves the attention
of the reader from fatigue. It serves, also, to
mark the distinction between the first half, which is
a specification of the causes of failure, and the second
half, which states the effects that followed from
them. The recurrence of &ldquo;department&rdquo; adds to
the emphasis in a way which may easily be appreciated
by replacing it by a pronoun. Repetitions
so cleverly used as this are of course not defects
but beauties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>The variation of form is an art more cunning
than that of the changing of the word. Look at
this sentence from Stevenson, and notice how much
is gained by the alteration of the construction:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>How often and willingly do I not look in fancy on
Tummel, or Manor, or the talking Ardle, or Dee swirling
in its Lynn; on the bright burn of Kinnaird, or
the golden burn that pours and sulks in the den behind
Kingussie!&mdash;<i>Pastoral.</i></p></div>

<p class="noindent">To put &ldquo;talking&rdquo;
before its noun and &ldquo;swirling&rdquo;
after the substantive it modifies, to see to it that
no two phrases shall have the same form, may
seem small matters, and yet it is by devices of this
sort that the skillful artificer of words gives to his
style finish and charm.</p>

<p>The ability to command a variety of forms gives
to the writer the power of repetition without seeming
to repeat. Often it happens that it is well to
re-say a thing, either for the sake of putting it in a
light somewhat different from that of its first presentation,
or to enforce it more strongly. This is
especially true, it may be, of writing which is expository
or argumentative, but the need of repetition
of ideas is common to composition of all sorts. To
vary the cadence of the sentence so that the ear
shall never be wearied by monotony, cunningly to
mix long and short paragraphs so that no single
form constantly repeated shall tire the attention, is
indeed a difficult art to acquire. No rule can be
given for variety; the very idea of rule for variation
involves a contradiction of terms, since it is
the essence of variation to be irregular. The student
must train his ear and his mind by reading the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
best authors; but the most that instruction can do
is to call attention to this matter, and thus to afford
a clue to what may be the real if unsuspected
cause of a writer&rsquo;s dissatisfaction when his work
appears vaguely dull and unattractive. Variety is
closely connected with Elegance. The adaptation
of the sentence structure to the thought, and yet
more the subtler adaptation to the mood, are refinements
of composition which it takes long to acquire;
but with every advance toward a mastery
of them the learner has come nearer to the secret
of that consummate skill in fitting means to effects
which is the soul of the highest style. Each must
do it for himself; for the secret of variety cannot
be told farther than it is revealed in the words of
Stevenson, with which we began: &ldquo;The one rule is
to be infinitely various.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon variety depends largely that delightful and
elusive quality which we call Euphony. No writer
or reader can be long insensible to that music of
words which is as intangibly tangible in prose as
in poetry,&mdash;different in the one from the other,
but as real and truly a source of delight in speech
as in song, in prose as in verse. It is true that
what is written is not necessarily read aloud. It is
written in silence, and untrained writers fail to realize
that although it be read in silence, the eye is
the ear of the mind, and all melody or lack of melody
will be subtilely felt in the soundless perusal.
All that has been said of variety applies as well
to this quality; and, indeed, it is perhaps hardly
necessary to give two names where the two things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
are so closely interwoven.</p>

<p>Intangible as this quality may seem, it is yet one
of the most striking in literature. Take this sentence
from Walt Whitman, and see if it is possible
for any reader not to be offended by its close:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Nor shades of Virgil, nor myriad memories, poems,
old associations, magnetize and hold on to her.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Or suppose one said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>If for the city of Athens nature did much, it is
not to be denied that art did a great deal more.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">The ear is dull which does not perceive the difference
between this and the sentence as Newman
wrote it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>If nature did much for Athens, it is undeniable
that art did much more.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Examples might be multiplied indefinitely, but it
is better that the student find them for himself.
Sensitiveness to euphony and the practical acquirement
of a euphonious style are greatly aided by the
habit of reading aloud the works of men who are
masters, and it is well to test in the same way whatever
is written. The ear is more readily trained
by the voice than by any other means. It is possible
to suppose that what we have written must
sound well as a matter of course; but if we read
or hear it read aloud, and find that it does not
please the ear, only one stupid with self-conceit
will leave it unaltered. A melodious diction is apt
to be made up more largely of short words than of
long ones, and of words easily pronounced than of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>those trying to the tongue; yet it is no more possible
to achieve a euphonious style simply by using
words short and easily pronounced than it is to
make a beautiful brook by digging a channel which
shall be entirely straight and free from obstructions,
or to build a beautiful temple by collecting
exquisite marbles. Construction is more than material.</p>

<p>One of the means by which it was formerly the
fashion to strive after pleasing sound in diction
was the use of alliteration. This device is somewhat
in disrepute in these days, because it has been
so notoriously abused. The sensational novelist
could no more do without alliteration than without
the historical present tense. The patent medicines
are alliteratively labeled; comic operas and pseudo-Queen
Anne cottages at little watering-places have
been baptized with titles with reduplicated initials,
until the writer who indulges in alliteration feels
something as does the professor who sees his title
blazoned on the shingle of the barber and the boot-black.</p>

<p>Yet this pleasant device cannot be spared. There
is in our blood some trace of the fondness for it
which made it serve the old bards instead of rhyme.
It must be employed more cunningly than of old,
and as it were slipped into the literary web surreptitiously.
Here are instances:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A man is a bundle of <i class="cor">r</i>elations, a knot of <i
class="cor">r</i>oots, whose <i class="cor">f</i>lower and <i
class="cor">f</i>ruitage is the world.&mdash;Emerson:
<i>History</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In making edu<i class="cor">c</i>ation not only <i
class="cor">c</i>ommon to all, but in some sense <i
class="cor">c</i>ompulsory on all.&mdash;Lowell: <i>New England Two
Centuries Ago</i>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>All the beautiful <i class="cor">s</i>entiments in the <i
class="cor">w</i>orld <i class="cor">w</i>eigh less than a <i
class="cor">s</i>ingle lovely action.&mdash;<i>Id.</i>: <i>Rousseau
and the Sentimentalists</i>.</p></div>

<p>Here there is little more than the repetition
of the initial of a prominent word, marked by the
same place in successive cadences. Often alliteration
in modern prose of the best sort is carried
much farther. Here are a couple of examples from
Stevenson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I know a child of Suffolk whose fancy still <i
class="cor">l</i>ingers about the <i class="cor">l</i>i<i
class="cor">l</i>ied <i class="cor">l</i>ow<i class="cor">l</i>and
waters of that shire.&mdash;<i>Pastoral.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>A task in <i class="cor">r</i>ecitation that <i class="cor">r</i>eally
merited <i class="cor">r</i>eward.&mdash;<i>The Manse.</i></p></div>

<p>Of course I am speaking only of prose. The
diction of poetry is governed by different laws,
and the reduplication of sound is a recognized and
not infrequent ornament of verse used to a degree
which would not be tolerated in prose. In the
latter it is important that alliteration shall appear
to be rather the consequence of the subject than
an extraneous ornament. Once a writer introduces
into prose a word which is evidently or even
apparently chosen for its initial, he has given the
reader a suspicion of artificiality which is fatal to
the best effect.</p>

<p>Alliteration is, however, more readily allowed in
epigram and antithesis than in plain, straightforward
passages. The writer is permitted some
especial graces of ornament when he attempts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>either of these, as a child may without remark wear
its best raiment to a party when its companions
would jeer at such display at school. &ldquo;Forms are
the food of faith,&rdquo; writes Newman. &ldquo;All mankind
love a lover,&rdquo; Emerson says. These epigrams are
openly alliterative. No less so is the well-known
antithesis of Macaulay, &ldquo;The Puritans hated bear-baiting,
not because it gave pain to the bear, but
because it gave pleasure to the spectator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The epigram has the great advantage of recalling
the proverb; and proverbs will ever be dear to the
heart of man as the purses in which have been preserved
the homely wisdom of the world. It is perhaps
in part because of its family likeness to the
proverb that it seems not unfitting for the epigram
to balance word against word in a way which would
seem artificial in any other form of expression.</p>

<p>The mention of epigram and antithesis reminds
us that it is well to speak briefly of both.</p>

<p>Antithesis is the setting formally against each
other of contrasting thoughts. I might make an
example if I wrote: Epigram is a sword with one
edge; but antithesis is a blade with two. I should
at the same time be expressing to some extent the
characteristics of these verbal forms. Antithesis
defines by differences; epigram emphasizes a single
idea. One confesses its artificiality by its balanced
structure; the other endeavors to hide it under an
appearance of lucky spontaneity. Antithesis is
obviously deliberate; epigram must have an air of
quickness, as if it were the birth of the moment.
The former belonged to the elaborate style of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>more ceremonious age; the latter has been cultivated
in the prose of our own time until it has
almost become a vice.</p>

<p>The above paragraph, which is largely antithetical,
shows the limitation of this form. It is not
possible long to continue this sort of writing without
wearying the reader with a sense of artificiality.
Such pleasure as the present age is willing to take
in undisguised effort in prose is largely confined to
the epigram.</p>

<p>An epigram is a notion rounded like a snowball
for throwing. Looked at in another way, it is
a thought packed for quick transportation. It is
wit or wisdom given wings; or, if it be neither, it
is at least an idea with its loins girt for running.
Sometimes it is a base or worthless reflection set in
terse phrase, like a fly in amber; or a cruel insinuation
wounding like a wasp with envenomed sting.
At its best it is a jewel of price; at its worst it is
a drop of subtle poison.</p>

<p>Here, somewhat at the risk of confusing by a
variety of images, I have tried to write a short
paragraph which is practically all in the form of
epigrams. It is in turn evident that although less
obviously artificial than antithesis, epigrams are
apt to lack spontaneity, no matter how much they
strive for it. It is difficult to incorporate them
into ordinary prose so that they shall seem really
to be an integral part of it. An epigram is apt to
be like a shell, so complete and individual in itself
that it is hard to make it appear to be a part of
any other whole. Skillfully handled, the epigram
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
gives crispness and vigor to a style, but by so
much the more as it is effective if successful it
is damaging if it fails. It is to be remembered,
too, that the habit of striving for any especial verbal
form is a dangerously fascinating one. It is
easy to fall into the way of making phrases for
their own sake, instead of for the purpose of expressing
what one has to say. An epigram is valuable
and commendable only in so far as it serves
the purpose for which it is contrived. The Greeks
used the word originally to signify a verse inscribed
on a tomb, and not a few modern epigrams are the
epitaphs of thoughts killed in making them.</p>

<p>We are accustomed to-day to employ the word
for any concise and terse expression of thought,
and to call that style epigrammatic which is distinguished
by conciseness and by brief and pregnant
sentences. Broadly speaking, so long as the
writer keeps in mind that the epigram is to aid
expression, and that intention is never to be sacrificed
to form, the more of these qualities his style
has the better. He must remember, moreover,
that the ear must be relieved by sentences of varied
length. The successful epigram is almost always
brief, and it must contain an element of novelty.
One of its chief claims to attention is that it puts
its thought in a form which excites surprise. It is
like the German bonbon, which parts with a startling
snap and discloses a gift within. The more it
has the air of being the result of an instantaneous,
happy inspiration, the more effective is it. An
epigram must seem at least to be like the poet, born
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>and not made.</p>

<p>This matter of novelty concerns more than epigram.
Words and phrases become worn as surely
as coins which have long passed from hand to hand.
Epithets which have been constantly repeated lose
the force of their original intent and fail to produce
their first effect. The masters of style do not hesitate
now and then to coin new words with which to
serve themselves in the attempt to produce pungent
effects which old terms no longer yield. Carlyle
is an extreme example of this, and a list of the extraordinary
novelties which he boldly made for his
own use would fill pages. He exposed himself to
the danger of losing the impression which he produced
as soon as the words invented lost their first
novelty, and no doubt something of the diminution
of the influence of Carlyle which we have lived to
see is due to this very cause. The ordinary writer
is not allowed thus to serve his need by invention.
He must be content to take words already in use,
and must display his ingenuity by contriving so to
employ them that from old terms he brings freshness
of effect.</p>

<p>The novelty which is within the reach of all is
that of originality. It seems at first startling to
speak of originality as within common reach when
we take up every day books wherein the writers
show so absolute a lack of all originality that they
shake one&rsquo;s very belief in original sin. Yet remember
what Flaubert said to De Maupassant:
&ldquo;The smallest thing has in it something unknown.
Discover it&hellip;. That is the way to become original.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>Life can never appear the same to any two human
beings, because no two look at it with the same
eyes or with the same mind. The original writer is
he who sets down his own thoughts, who shows to
others what is exactly in his own brain and heart.
It is not within the power of every author thus to
create profoundly fresh and inspiring works; but
it is within the reach of all to say something which
shall be at once new and individual and vital.</p>

<p>What is called individuality is the result of this
frank and sincere speaking of the thought which
comes to the writer and as it comes to the writer.
It is needful to be on one&rsquo;s guard lest sometimes
instead of being guided by sincerity and natural
honesty one fall into the trick of using particular
forms of diction or construction. We are all exposed
to the danger of imitating ourselves. Having
once written a thing which by its honesty and
frankness was impressive, there is a temptation to
go on repeating the same thing or to try to do
something which shall seem like it. In this way
arise what are known as mannerisms. The difference
between individuality and mannerism is that
between sincerity and egotism; between personality
and affectation. Individuality in style is an
honest embodying of that which makes the writer
different from any other man alive; mannerism is
the sham&mdash;if unconscious&mdash;effort to appear different.
Be truthfully exact in saying nothing
but what is really felt, and individuality is as sure
as mannerism is impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Read what Lowell says of Chaucer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Chaucer seems to me to have been one of the most
purely original of poets&hellip;. He is original not in the
sense that he thinks and says what nobody ever thought
or said before, and what nobody can ever think and
say again, but because he is always natural; because,
if not absolutely new, he is always delightfully fresh;
because he sets before us the world as it honestly appeared
to Geoffrey Chaucer, and not a world as it seemed
proper to certain people that it ought to appear.</p></div>

<p>There you have the whole of it. He who is
least concerned about being original, and most engrossed
in expressing precisely the thought and the
feeling which have come to him, is in the end the
writer who is most vitally and perennially fresh.
Think new thoughts always if you can; but above
all do not put a thought upon paper unless you so
honestly and sincerely think it that it does not
occur to you to consider whether anybody else has
or has not said this thing before.</p>

<h2><a name="IX" id="IX">IX</a></h2>

<p class="captitle">CLASSIFICATION</p>


<p>Thus far we have spoken of the general principles
of composition, and of qualities which are
common to all attempts to express thought by
written language. There are so many ways, however,
in which composition may be employed, that
for further consideration it is convenient to divide
it into classes. We have come to the place where
it is well to serve ourselves with some division of
the sorts of writing, just as we before found it well
to serve ourselves by the separation of general
principles.</p>

<p>Classification is necessary in any study, not only
for convenience in handling, but for clearness of
conception. If ideas are arranged systematically,
they not only are remembered more easily, but
their mutual relations are discovered, and their
relative values more accurately estimated. It is of
importance, however, to recognize that in all investigations
classification is not an end, but a means.
He who classifies clears the way for future work,
either of his own or of others, but he does not
necessarily reach anything permanent or effective
in itself. The student of botany may analyze and
tabulate all the plants in the land; but if he has
not reached out toward general truths and fundamental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>principles, it cannot be said that he has
learned much. He has amused himself, perhaps
has had a good deal of healthful out-of-door life,
and a certain amount of mental gymnastics,&mdash;but
that is the whole of it. Classification, and especially
classification which is not original, is not the
attainment of knowledge in any high sense.</p>

<p>I pause to comment upon this at more length
than the connection warrants, strictly speaking,
because the subject is one of so great general importance.
Everywhere in his studies the learner
finds classification set up as a ladder by means of
which he may climb to knowledge. Most students
fall to counting the rungs of the ladder, to measuring
the spaces between them, to informing themselves
carefully who made it. Unless in the waste
of time there is no harm in this, if, after all, the
ladder be really used, and if the learner be clear-headed
enough to realize that all this is of no more
than relative value. Classification is the means by
which the mind is able to master a subject, but it
is not the subject itself. To classify originally it is
necessary to understand the relations of things, and
the investigators by whom classes are defined must
of course be thoroughly well informed in regard to
the facts upon which arrangement is based. The
ordinary student is constantly in danger of accepting
the formal schedule instead of the truths which
it represents; of filling his mind with nomenclature
instead of principles; of being, in a word, satisfied
with system in place of knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>All essential and ultimate knowledge is natural,
and all classification is artificial. Classification is
founded upon natural facts, but it is an enumeration
rather than an elucidation. It arranges; it
does not explain.</p>

<p>Understand that I do not undervalue classification.
The student can no more advance without
it than he could climb to a roof without a ladder.
I merely wish to impress upon you the fact that
in all work&mdash;and perhaps especially in scientific
work&mdash;it is of the highest importance to keep
steadily in mind that it is not the ladder but the
ascent which is of consequence; that the aim is not
the schedule but the secrets of wisdom to which it
helps us.</p>

<p>Thus it is that it is not for any value in the
distinction itself, but solely as an expedient for
our convenience in acquiring knowledge which is
of worth, that we divide the sorts of composition.
We classify, as in microscopy it is necessary to
make sections for ease of examination. Do not
fail to classify; but do not fail also to remember
that nomenclature is not knowledge, that classification
is not wisdom.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>It is hardly necessary to remark how varied are
the effects which writers may endeavor to produce.
One is intent simply upon giving a clear and prosaic
account of some matter; making a straightforward
appeal to the understanding, and not
troubling himself to go beyond this. A second is
bent upon conveying to his readers some emotion,
overpowering or delicate, painful or joyous, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>case may be. A third aims only to amuse; a
fourth is determined to convince, to persuade, or
to overcome; and so on through the long list of
objects which are conceivable as coming within the
scope of the writer&rsquo;s range of intention.</p>

<p>Obviously, the treatment must be varied as the
effect sought alters, and we divide compositions into
classes by their most strongly marked characteristics.
Different authorities have varied the number
of divisions, and I have not felt bound to follow
any of them. It seems to me well to assume that
the kinds of composition are Exposition, Argument,
Description, and Narration; and to take up their
examination in this order.</p>

<p>From the classification commonly received this
differs in a change of order and in the omission of
Persuasion. Some writers, indeed, include here
both Criticism and Translation; but Criticism is
really a species of exposition, while Translation
is whatever sort of composition its original may
happen to be. That Persuasion should so long
have been retained in the list is curious, although
not so strange as might appear from the name.
Persuasion, in the strict sense of the term, is of
course not a kind of composition, but a quality of
style. An argument, an exposition, a narrative,
must alike be persuasive to succeed in winning the
reader. Indeed, persuasion is a quality essential
to all art. In the sense of being that which leads
others to submit their personality to the artist, it is
necessary to painter, musician, sculptor, and architect,
no less than to writer. As used to designate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
a department of composition, Persuasion has been
that which addresses, which appeals to the passions
directly.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The term is not a happy one, since it
would seem that the vocative&mdash;the mood of address&mdash;might
include denunciation, or invective,
or praise, as well as persuasion. The obvious explanation
of the use of such a division of composition
seems to be that it was made to provide
a place of dignity for oratory. In the days of
our forefathers the art of eloquence held a high
station, such as it is not likely to occupy soon
again; and it was evidently felt that there should
be a separate department for it in formal rhetoric.
Persuasion as a division of composition seems to
have been provided for oratory, much as a sinecure
is established for a court favorite; but since platform
eloquence has fallen somewhat into obscurity,
it has been realized that Exposition and Argument
cover the whole ground. If such a division were
to exist still, it would be better to call it Oratory
and be done with it; but if there were to be a fifth
kind of composition, there is more ground for trespassing
on the domain of Narrative and naming it
Dramatization.</p>

<p>As a reason for departing from the time-honored
custom of putting Description and Narrative before
Exposition and Argument, I might perhaps
content myself with saying that it is being found
by instructors in whose judgment I have the highest
confidence that the new order is the better.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
This is in part due to the fact that inexperienced
writers naturally suppose that they can describe
and narrate without having had especial training,
and it is less difficult to detach them from bad
habits of composition, if they begin with a sort of
writing in which they have not contracted faults
already. To put pupils in advanced composition
first upon Description and Narration is apt to be
to expose them to the danger of repeating whatever
bad literary habits they may have, since it is
in these forms of production that they are most
likely to have contracted them. Another point of
importance is that Description and Narration are
so much more attractive and easily emotional than
Exposition and Argument. I have already said
that technique can be readily mastered only in an
unemotional way. The great performers upon
musical instruments have almost always been those
who were trained technically while they were still
so young or so undeveloped that the emotional
capabilities of their nature were not matured.
There is great danger in allowing the emotions
to be aroused while training which is merely technical
is going on. Awaken in the pupil all interest
in technical perfection which is possible; to excite
his emotional interest in subject or sentiment is
dangerous, and obstructs his progress in the cultivation
of skill in form and technique. Technical
facility is gained by work not in itself inspiring,
but done with the most patient exactness for the
sake of the power it gives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Assuming, then, that it is convenient to consider
composition as being divided into the four sorts
named, and that there are sufficient reasons for
taking them in the order given, we find it necessary
next to define. Making broad definitions,
and leaving finer distinctions to be considered later,
we may say:&mdash;</p>

<p>Exposition is a statement, an explanation, or a
setting forth.</p>

<p>Argument is the endeavor to establish the truth
or falsity of an idea or a proposition.</p>

<p>Description is the endeavor to present a picture.</p>

<p>Narration is a record of events.</p>

<p>If a traveler, for instance, should write of the
Acropolis at Athens, he might treat the subject in
any one of several ways. If he discuss its architectural
character, its beauty, and the æsthetic
feelings of delight which this awakens, if he explain
its use, or make statements of any sort about
it, he is making an Exposition; if he endeavor to
establish the truth or untruth of especial views of
its use, of theories of its age, or of any matters
subject to controversy, he passes into Argument;
if he by words strives to call up in the mind of the
reader a picture of that glorious ruin, he is describing
it; while, if he tell the story of the temple, he
is evidently dealing in Narrative.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that these varieties
of composition melt into one another. In a work
of any extent, it is generally probable that all of
them will be employed. As an engraver, cutting
his block of box-wood, uses first one tool and then
another, according to the line demanded by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
picture, striving to bring out the effect which the
artist desires, so the skilled writer takes up one
variety of composition after another, employs now
this and now that. It is the old question of adapting
the method to the end sought, the effort to
the effect desired. In almost any book there will
be found Exposition, Argument, Description, and
Narrative, as in a single rose are sepals, petals,
stamens, and pistils. We study these separately,
but always the art of writing is one as the rose is
one.</p>

<p class="captitle">EXPOSITION</p>

<p>Doubtless you all remember the amazement of
the &ldquo;Bourgeois Gentilhomme&rdquo; of Molière when
he suddenly discovered that he had been speaking
prose all his life without suspecting it. We may
be in the same situation when it first becomes clear
to us that without being aware of it we have been
making expositions from the time we began first
to speak. The statements, the explanations, the
opinions which we give by hundreds every day are
simply expositions in little. What we have to do
now is merely to discover if possible what are the
principles which will make the same sort of thing
effective when it is carried further than in common
speech, and is put in written instead of in spoken
words.</p>

<p>To expound is to set forth the nature, the significance,
the characteristics, and the bearing of
an idea or a group of ideas. Exposition therefore
differs from Description in that it deals directly
with the meaning or intent of its subject instead
of with its appearance. A good deal which we are
accustomed inexactly to call description is really
exposition. Suppose that your small boy wishes
to know how an engine works, and should say:
&ldquo;Please describe the steam-engine to me.&rdquo; If you
insist upon taking his words literally&mdash;and are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
willing to run the risk of his indignation at being
willfully misunderstood,&mdash;you will to the best of
your ability picture to him this familiarly wonderful
machine. If you explain it to him, you are
not describing but expounding it; you are not
making a Description but an Exposition, in so far
as these words are applied in our present sense.
The exact boundary lines of Exposition&mdash;or, for
that matter, of any sort of composition&mdash;it is impossible
to draw sharply. Not everything which
claims to explain really makes clear, any more than
all which wears the air of virtue shall escape
scorching in &ldquo;the everlasting bonfire.&rdquo; One thing
merges into another, and in the end all composition,
as has been said and repeated already, is an
indivisible whole.</p>

<p>The inexactness with which all terms of classification
are used and must be used in literature is
illustrated by the extension of the word &ldquo;essay,&rdquo;
under which are grouped so many sorts of expositions.
It has become the custom to apply this
name to almost any brief monograph of leisurely
or reflective character. The critical papers of
Hazlitt, the historical orgies of Macaulay, the
humorous confidences of Charles Lamb, and the
argumentative tracts of Newman on theology or of
Ruskin upon social questions, are all loosely classed
together as essays. In contemporary writings, the
suggestive mediæval studies of Vernon Lee, papers
by Walter Pater from which the life has been
exquisitely elaborated, the intimate revelations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
nature by Richard Jefferies or John Burroughs, the
delightful word-sonatas of Stevenson, and the criticisms
of Leslie Stephen, fine and scholarly, are
all given the same convenient name. The term
&ldquo;essay&rdquo; is not unlike that useful contrivance
known to travelers as a &ldquo;hold-all,&rdquo; into which may
be huddled whatever there is not room for in more
dignified receptacles. Fortunately the harm done
is too small to matter. If a thing is good it is of
no great consequence what we call it.</p>

<p>In an age like this, when the magazine flourishes
and newspapers are thick strewn like sodden leaves
in a November storm, the exposition is naturally
one of the most common and one of the most practically
useful of all forms of composition. The
modern endeavor to make all men understand
everything of course renders necessary an enormous
amount of expository writing; so that the press
turns out daily and hourly an innumerable number
of small essays upon all imaginable topics. We
live in an expository era. The scientific spirit
demands that all knowledge shall be set forth,
often to the discouragement of more imaginative
forms of composition. This sort of work is certainly
the one for which there is to-day the most
constant and urgent call. The utilitarian would
get along pretty much to his own satisfaction if no
other form of writing than Exposition had been
invented; and this is a utilitarian age.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>Of all the qualities which we have hitherto considered,
the one most likely to tell in Exposition is
Clearness. In practical work the essential thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>g
here is to make accurately intelligible the meaning
which the writer would convey. In all more delicate
matters this is impossible without recourse to
the higher arts of literary technique; but in general
all grace of style, all persuasiveness of presentation,
all elegance of proportion and of manner,
are subordinated to this primary necessity of lucidity.
If one is striving to produce permanent literature
these must not be neglected; but as far
as common, practical, workaday prose is concerned,
everything else is considered as of less importance
than the conveying to the reader with sharpness the
exact significance of what the writer is endeavoring
to phrase.</p>

<p>Two things may be briefly remarked in passing:
First, that this characteristic need of clear-cut
accuracy makes especially appropriate the taking
up of Exposition at the start; and second, that
this sort of composition is of great help in intellectual
growth. It is not that the other forms of
expression do not call for accuracy. There is as
much need for exactness in the imparting of fine
shades of emotion suggested by a description or
by a narrative as in the statement of an opinion.
It is more easy, however, for the student to grasp
the more tangible matter than the more subtile.
He more readily appreciates the process of direct
expression than that of delicate implication. It is
true that Exposition in its higher forms deals with
thought and emotion; but even there it handles
them rather in a direct than in an indirect manner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
rather by statement than by suggestion.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to see how the practice of this
sort of composition is an aid to intellectual progress.
Indeed, education is after all largely the
phrasing for ourselves a statement of the truths of
life and of the world about us. This sort of writing
forces the learner to think sharply and clearly,
to realize his thoughts. Exposition leads the student
really to think instead of contenting himself
with that mental muddlement in which the mind
goes around and around, playfully like a kitten
chasing its tail or earnestly after the fashion of a
squirrel in his wheel, but getting ahead in neither
case.</p>

<p>The two qualities which are, after clearness, most
valuable in this species of writing are unity of the
whole work and progression. The nature of Unity
has already been sufficiently commented upon, but
it is worth while to speak of a mechanical device by
which much can be done to secure it. This is the
making of a plan of an exposition before writing it.
I have seldom found a student who willingly wrote
out a skeleton of an exercise, and authors are hardly
less reluctant to bother to put upon paper the plan
of an essay. I am aware from my own experience
how many excuses for not doing this necessary
piece of drudgery may be invented by the evasive
mind. It is of course a bore, when the head is full
of a theme, to be obliged to stop and in a cold-blooded
manner construct the framework of the
essay which we are eager to dash off at full speed.
Yet in the end it is a saving of time. It is better
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
to do this in the first place than to have to pull the
work to pieces afterward. When the mind is alert
and excited, make notes, phrase the vital portions
of the essay, set down the significant thoughts
which come to you; but before attempting to
write the completed whole have all these notes,
these images, these phrases, arranged with reference
to a plan, a schedule of the entire composition.
This may be slight, but it should be essentially
complete in the sense that it covers the whole
ground. I believe it to be practically impossible
for any writer to secure unity in a work of any
extent without making a preliminary plan of some
kind; and only men of rare gifts and much experience
can safely carry this in the head. It is
certainly true that the inexperienced writer should
not trust himself to attempt any composition more
than a page or two in length without actually writing
out a skeleton beforehand.</p>

<p>As a matter of practical work, a young writer
who is attempting an exposition should begin by
thinking out his subject and putting his thoughts
on paper. He should strive to phrase them well
when he makes his first memoranda, for thoughts
are like metal, much more malleable when they are
hot. Often an ugly phrase which could without
much trouble have been improved when it was
making becomes stubbornly intractable after it has
been for a time on paper. It is convenient to have
these notes on slips of paper, since it is thus easy
to arrange and to rearrange them. It is also of
importance to consider how a subject will appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
to a reader whose views are opposed to those of
the writer. Think up all possible objections that
might be made to the ideas expressed. Turn the
subject over, and examine the wrong side; this
is the best way to judge of the strength and the
smoothness of the seams by which the parts are
joined to make a whole.</p>

<p>The next step is to arrange the thoughts noted
down. Make a plan of the essay with reference
to its logical continuity. Look at the framework
as a single thing. Remember that it is upon the
completeness and sufficiency of this that the finished
work must depend for its unity and its effect
as a whole. To this scheme fit your notes. Do
not trouble as yet about ornament or finish unless
pregnant illustration or happy phrase suggest itself
unsought. You cannot afford to go seeking
these graces until the more substantial portions of
your work are practically complete. Write slowly
or swiftly according to your temperament,&mdash;but
whatever your temperament do not suppose that
good work is to be done otherwise than systematically
and thoroughly.</p>

<p>Once the form is complete, the more you finish
and polish the better. It is true that it is possible
to polish the life out of a composition; but this
is a danger much farther along the road than I
should presume to act as a guide. I do not suppose
that any author liable to spoil his work from
over-finish is likely to trouble himself about what
I may say on the subject; and certainly this fault
lies so far ahead of most of us that we need not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
from fear of it stay our hand.</p>

<p>When the essay is planned and written and polished,
and if possible laid aside and taken out and
polished over again,&mdash;why, then, I am tempted
to say, the wisest rule is that given by Edward
Lear for the making of &ldquo;Crumbobblious Cutlets:&rdquo;
&ldquo;Procure some strips of beef, and having cut them
into the smallest possible slices, proceed to cut
them still smaller,&mdash;eight or perhaps nine times.&rdquo;
When you have made the work as good as you can
make it, proceed to make it better still,&mdash;eight or
perhaps nine times!</p>

<p>It is not impossible that it may occur to you that
this sounds a good deal like hard work. I said to
you in the beginning that to succeed in writing is a
laborious task. It is a task infinitely interesting,
and it is this which makes it endurable. The fine
arts are possible only because men do not spare
labor even if what is done must be wrought in the
sweat of the brow and with the blood of the heart;
art lives because the artist works from love, and
does not count the cost. Unless the worker is
willing thus to labor at literature, he will do well
to leave it alone. If his heart is not in it he will in
the end but waste good paper and ink which might
have served better workmen for better uses.</p>

<p>Keeping still to practical details, we may note
that it is well to accustom the mind to measure
compositions by the number of words. This is
the professional method, and it is the only way of
coming at a fairly accurate idea of the size of a
work and the proportionate length of its parts. It
is not difficult to get into the mind a standard in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the number of words one usually writes on a page.
Once this is done, the rest is easy. The page becomes
a personal measure of extent, and by it one
without difficulty estimates the bulk of the whole
or any part of a manuscript. Whoever has dealings
with periodicals or with publishers is sure to
come to this question of the number of words sooner
or later, and it is well to learn it early.</p>

<p>One of the cleverest of American playwrights
told me that he had made a careful study of the
dramas of the modern French authors to see how
many words they use to produce an effect. So
many words he found to be the average for a love
scene, so many in this situation and so many in
that. It was not that he endeavored to follow
exactly these rules; but he was thus getting at
the secrets of construction. This was a practical
method of judging proportions. The incident is
worth mention not only as an illustration of the
way in which words are used as a measure in literature,
but also as showing how tirelessly and with
what minute care the professional worker is willing
to labor.</p>

<p>One of the first practical uses to which the student
is called to apply this measure of the number
of words is that of estimating proportion. The
space given to any division of a subject, the number
of words in which it is embodied, largely determines
its relation to the whole. It is somewhat
difficult to illustrate this point, but by way of indicating
the sort of analysis which it is well for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
student now and then to make of essays which he
finds especially effective, I must give an example.
I have taken Macaulay&rsquo;s essay of Machiavelli,
and made a summary of it with a view of showing
the proportionate length at which this clever
author writes of the different points upon which he
touches. In this paper he is setting forth his view
of the character of that dazzlingly clever Italian
whose family name has furnished the language
with an epithet for whatever is most trickily cunning,
while by an absurd paradox his Christian
name is held to have given us an affectionate
pseudonym for the devil,&mdash;&ldquo;Old Nick.&rdquo; The
whole monograph is something in the nature of
a special plea, and without great violation of propriety
might be smuggled under Argument. It is
an attempt to show that the characteristics in the
writings of Machiavelli which have made his name
a hissing and a byword belong rather to the time
than to the man.</p>

<p>After a brief introduction follows a statement of
the disrepute in which Machiavelli has been held.
This is intentionally made strong to the verge of
absurdity, and to it is added a brief acknowledgment
that &ldquo;The Prince,&rdquo; Machiavelli&rsquo;s famous and
infamous book, is indeed shocking. This requires
about three hundred and fifty words.</p>

<p>Assuming the attitude which he wishes the
reader to take, that of a puzzled seeker for truth,
Macaulay states several theories which might
account for the moral obliquity of the Italian, yet
points out that his personal career was elevated,
patriotic, and just; and that there is in &ldquo;The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Prince&rdquo; much good as well as much evil. He
also calls attention to the fact that at the time the
book was written it apparently shocked nobody.
To this are given about eight hundred words.</p>

<p>This leads directly to the conclusion which is the
key-note of the whole essay:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It is, therefore, in the state of moral feeling among
the Italians of those times that we must seek for the
real explanation of what seems most mysterious in the
life of this remarkable man.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">This proposition being the one which it is the aim
of the essay to establish, nearly seventy-five hundred words, almost
half of the whole, are given to tracing the growth of the peculiar
conditions of moral sentiment which obtained in Italy in the time when
Machiavelli wrote. The subject is led on toward the next point in this
way:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Every age and every nation has certain characteristic
vices&hellip;. Posterity, &hellip; finding the delinquents
too numerous to be all punished, &hellip; selects some of
them at hazard to bear the whole penalty&hellip;. In the
present case the lot has fallen on Machiavelli; a man
whose public conduct was upright and honorable.</p></div>

<p>The essayist then turns from the man to his
work, pointing out the merits of his novels, comedies,
and letters. About twenty-three hundred
words are given to this,&mdash;rather more than an
eighth of the paper. Some eighteen hundred
follow on his public services. His struggles to
establish a regular army are emphasized, both because
here he appears to the best advantage, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
because this line of thought is artfully made to
lead up to and to suggest the view of &ldquo;The Prince&rdquo;
which is put forward immediately after: the view
that the book was really designed to forward the
substitution of a regular army for the mercenary
troops which had demoralized all Italy. The proportion
is here admirably judged. Enough space
is given to the matter to make the point seem one
of dignity and weight, yet not so much as to let it
appear as if the author were insisting upon it too
much. The economy of effect is observed throughout;
enough is always done, but never too much.</p>

<p>We have now, roughly speaking, thirteen thousand
out of the not much over sixteen thousand
words in the essay; and the author has practically
done his work. He has pretty well developed his
theory, and the remainder of the monograph is
given to making it more clear and to enforcing it.
To the personal merit of Machiavelli is devoted
about a quarter of the entire essay; to the immorality
of the age and its influence upon him, nearly
one half; to the admirable way in which he played
his part in public life, nearly an eighth. To the
hatred and abhorrence of Machiavelli which the
essayist desires to overcome, he gives directly but
three or four hundred words in the whole sixteen
thousand. Proportion so careful and so effective
as this can only be the result of studied and accurate
design.</p>

<p>A word of caution may not be amiss. Proportion
is to be determined not by the interest of the
writer or by his ease in writing upon particular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
points, but by the relation of the parts to the
whole. The reason for saying this is that almost
any author is liable to be led away by the facility
with which it is possible for him to enlarge upon
certain points. An opportunity presents itself for
the introduction of a charming episode; there is
a temptation to develop a thought, a sentiment, a
seductively favorite theory; and the result of yielding
to this is apt to be a violation of unity. What
the old-fashioned writers&mdash;as if confession were
an excuse&mdash;were accustomed to confess by saying,
&ldquo;But this is a digression,&rdquo; hopelessly injured
the effect of a composition as a whole. Only the
clever and cunning artificer of style can introduce
digressions without marring the fair proportions of
the complete work.</p>

<p>Proportion, here as elsewhere, is emotional as
well as mechanical. One must bear in mind the
fact that a few emphatic words are of more account
than many mild and commonplace ones. Consider
not only the space given to particular portions of a
work, but the stress laid upon them.</p>

<p>And here it is well to consider a feature of
human frailty. Such is man&rsquo;s weakness that blame
always counts for more than praise. If I were to
say to you that looked at from a purely literary
standpoint &ldquo;The Heavenly Twins&rdquo; is morbid and
unhealthy rubbish; that &ldquo;Trilby&rdquo; is a pleasant
transient excitement; but that &ldquo;The Return of the
Native&rdquo; seems to me the most notable English
novel since Thackeray&mdash;you would have no difficulty
in remembering that I condemned &ldquo;The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Heavenly Twins;&rdquo; you would have a fairly clear
idea that I had been less enthusiastic than is the
general public about &ldquo;Trilby;&rdquo; and you would
perhaps recall vaguely that there was something
else&mdash;really it is astonishing how quickly a name
slips from the memory!&mdash;which I praised.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> The
point is one to be remembered when one is dealing
with delicate shades of emphasis.</p>

<p>As I have more than once used Carlyle in warning,
it is no more than fair to mention him here as
one of the masters of emotional emphasis. He had
an instinct for the proportion of stress, and used it
with the greatest success. It is an excellent lesson
in the study of this quality to analyze the cumulative
and unified effect of the stronger chapters of
the &ldquo;French Revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have spoken of progression as being one of the
important matters to be considered in connection
with Exposition. Perhaps a better name for what
I mean would be continuity. It is necessary to
arrange ideas in a logical order which is not only
unbroken, but which is perfectly obvious. It is
not enough that the author is aware how one
thought logically follows another; he must make
it evident to all who read. He must remember
that so long as the connection of ideas is clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
and inevitable the reader is led on unconsciously;
while every pause which the reader is forced to
make to see how one statement follows from another
leaves him less fully in the author&rsquo;s control.
So great a thinker and so great a writer as Emerson
materially lessened the circle of his readers by
a lack of this very quality. The ordinary student
often finds it hard to supply the thoughts which
make the sequence of ideas complete. Emerson
stalks like a giant from mountain peak of thought
to mountain peak, while the reader is often sorely
puzzled to know how to cross the deep gullies between.
Emerson was a genius, and prophesied so
gloriously on his mountain-tops, that we struggle
forward after him despite all difficulties. Those
who are not geniuses cannot hope that readers will
follow their lead unless the road is shown and the
chasms bridged.</p>

<p>One may go farther than this in insisting upon
the need of continuousness in literature. The
present age is impatient of being called upon to
take trouble in apprehension, so that it is necessary
to use every art&mdash;whether of connectives, of
arrangement of thought, of sequence of ideas or
incidents&mdash;to make more inevitably evident the
connection of parts. Indeed, this must be not
only plain but easy and attractive. To blaze out
a path through the woods avails in pioneer life
and in the beginnings of literature; but when
civilization has advanced, the way must be graded
until it is comfortable to the foot accustomed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
smooth pavements and velvet carpets. Sequence
in expository writing should usually be so complete
that the reader goes forward so glidingly that
the mere progress itself shall be a pleasure.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="captitle">EXPOSITION CONTINUED</p>


<p>In expository writing&mdash;and indeed the rule
might safely be applied to all composition&mdash;it
is wise to proceed from the near to the remote;
from cause to effect; from the physical to the
mental; from the clear to the obscure; and from
that which is generally allowed to that which is
doubtful or disputed.</p>

<p>It is well to proceed from the near to the remote.
We do not say &ldquo;All the way from London
to here,&rdquo; but &ldquo;All the way from here to
London.&rdquo; The exception would be when the point
of view is that of one in London, since then that
city would be the near, and &ldquo;here&rdquo; the remote.
&ldquo;Near&rdquo; in this connection is always near to the
point of view. We say, &ldquo;What we do will be
talked of all the way from here to London.&rdquo; We
say also, &ldquo;When Tom came home from England
last year, he was ill all the way from London to
here.&rdquo; We begin with that which the mind accepts
most readily. The principle is the same which we
have already found to underlie the use of figurative
language. There the unknown is made clear by
comparison with the known; and it is well to lead
the mind from what is near, physically or mentally,
to what is remote. Take this example from
Stevenson:&mdash;</p>

Beaconsfield and Mr. Gladstone have debated so much
in the House of Commons, and why Burnaby rode to
Khiva the other day, and why the Admirals courted
war like a mistress.&mdash;<i>The English Admirals.</i></p></div>

<p>This was published in England, and at a time
when the speeches of Lord Beaconsfield and Mr.
Gladstone were matters of every-day comment in
the newspaper; the ride to Khiva was famous, but
not so near in place or in realization, while the
bravery of the English Admirals was part of history
stretching back for centuries.</p>

<p>Here is illustration from Lowell:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>J. H., one of those choice poets who will not tarnish
their bright fancies by publication, always insists
on a snowstorm as essential to the true atmosphere of
whist. Mrs. Battles, in her famous rule for the game,
implies winter, and doubtless would have added tempest,
if it could be had for the asking. For a good,
solid read also, into the small hours, there is nothing
like that sense of safety against having your evening
laid waste, which Euroclydon brings, as he bellows
down the chimney.&mdash;<i>A Good Word for Winter.</i></p></div>

<p>Here we are given the pleasant saying of a
neighbor, such as any of us might have heard;
we go on to Mrs. Battles, dear to every reader of
Elia; and from that to Euroclydon, the wind which
put the apostle in danger of his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>The same principle of course holds good in dealing
wholly with ideas. Speaking of Leonardo da
Vinci, Walter Pater writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>He brooded over the hidden virtues of plants and
crystals, the lines traced by the stars as they moved
in the sky, over the correspondences which exist between
the different orders of living things, through
which, to eyes opened, they interpret each other; and
for years he seemed to those about him as one listening
to a voice silent for other men.</p></div>

<p>From the idea of the virtues of plants and
crystals, things which one might hold in the hand,
the mind is led to the stars, far yet visible; while
only after this is introduced the mysterious and
intangible bond which has been conceived of as
existing between all living things. Last of all is
the suggestion of that thing still more remote, the
silent voice heard only by the artist of all men who
walked the earth.</p>

<p>I read in a scientific book the other day, in the
description of a proposed machine, &ldquo;On account
of difficulty in handling and great weight, this is
unsuitable.&rdquo; Here the effect is put before the
cause, and the result is a loss of smoothness in
progression. The point of view is that of a scientist
who knows all about the machine, and he should
have written: &ldquo;great weight and consequent difficulty
of handling.&rdquo; If the point of view were that
of an investigator, the phrase might perhaps properly
be, &ldquo;difficulty in handling consequent upon
the great weight,&rdquo; because the investigator would
discover first the difficulty and then reflect upon
the cause. This may seem a little like hair splitting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
but no principle can be too closely examined,
and for the student there is no such thing as being
too careful in the study of means and effects.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion to speak of this matter
again, particularly in its application to description.
Here it is enough to add that the simplest course
is to follow in writing the order which seems most
natural; and then in revision to apply the rule
given at the beginning of this chapter.</p>

<p>The order which seems most natural will generally
be that in which the thoughts have presented
themselves to your own notice, and a perception of
this order is one of the advantages which belong
to the collection of material from personal experience.
Whoever has done literary work is likely
to have discovered how constantly the literary mind
must be on the alert. The daughters of the horse-leech
that in the Scriptures are said continually to
cry &ldquo;Give! Give!&rdquo; are less insatiable than is the
greedy pen of the professional writer. Like the
grave, it has never enough. He who makes literature
a profession must take for his model the
barnacle at high tide. As that busy and tireless
unpleasantness grasps ceaselessly with finger-like
tentacles, so the mind of the writer must be always
reaching out,&mdash;grasping, grasping, grasping,&mdash;until
the accumulation of ideas, of facts, of impressions,
with the realization that this is literary
material, becomes a second nature. Life itself
must for the professional writer be so much material.
Joy and sorrow, hope, disappointment, whatever
he sees and feels, must yield him something
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
which he may set down in words for the instruction
or the delight of others. It is not that his feelings
are less genuine than those of others; it is not
that he writes of his emotions as if they were his
own; it is simply that a sort of sub-consciousness
takes note always of the world around him and of
the world within him no less, seizing all fact and
emotion as stuff for the web it weaves.</p>

<p>And here, at the risk of setting down a platitude,
it may be well to say that it seems to me of the
utmost importance that the professional writer, and
especially the young aspirant for literary honors,
keep a note-book. It is as foolish to start upon
a literary career without the habit of jotting things
down as it would be to put to sea without water in
the casks. The need is especially great if one is
going into any sort of journalistic work, because
there is always danger of being called upon to
produce &ldquo;copy&rdquo; without warning and without material
offered either by the editor or by circumstances.
There is at such times a great practical
value in a well-filled note-book, while the moral
support is perhaps of importance even greater. No
man who has had literary experience will fail, I
believe, to realize the folly of trusting to memory
to hold and to bring forward at the right time the
thoughts, the reflections, or the facts which come
to one unexpectedly. The memory is apt to be
a careless servant. It mislays, it injures, it mars
the things which are intrusted to it. It is necessary
to acquire the habit of setting thoughts down,
and of setting them down at once. Do not delude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
yourself with the notion that you will recall in the
morning the clever phrase or acute deduction which
your brain evolves after you are tucked safely into
bed at night; that you can put upon paper at the
end of the journey the incident which struck you in
traveling. You may remember to make the record
later, but a thought is like a sunset,&mdash;the instant
it reaches its full glory it begins to fade. What
is written while it is fresh has a vitality, a spontaneity
which nothing can have that is recalled
and set down later. If you are reading and the
thought of the author suggests a reflection, throws
a sudden illumination upon some spot in your
mind hitherto in darkness, do not wait to finish
the chapter, but interrupt your reading to write
it down. It is a bother. No reader likes to break
off to use pencil and note-book,&mdash;but the professional
writer is forbidden to consider whether he
like a thing or not, if it will assist his progress.
The first thing in his life is his art,&mdash;moral questions
aside,&mdash;and to this he is to sacrifice everything.</p>

<p>Of the cultivation of the habit of observing, one
is almost ashamed to say anything, so often has
this been discussed. Every one who discourses
upon this subject has spoken of the prime necessity
of training the faculties of observation; yet every
one who shall discourse hereafter is likely to be
called upon to say the same thing. Remember
that if you lack material for writing, the fault
is entirely your own. The world is around you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
infinite and inexhaustible; the question is whether
you take what is at hand. Our daily walks and
ways afford us all that is needed&mdash;except the eye
to see and the heart to understand.</p>

<p>Yesterday&mdash;which you remember was a sharply
cold day&mdash;I had occasion to go down town. I
noticed at least three things any one of which
a clever writer might make the theme of a charming
little essay. I saw in the street-car a large,
middle-aged man, coarsely dressed, and of rather
a forbidding face. He was seated in a corner, and
gave an impression of surly ill-nature. A little,
thin, weazened lad of not more than six or seven,
with pinched features and starved look, poorly
clad, and seeming to have been always cold or
hungry when he was not both, came in and took
the seat next to this man. There was nothing to
indicate that the two knew each other, and indeed
the boy&rsquo;s air showed plainly enough that they did
not; but when the poor forlorn little fellow blew
on his small, grimy fists, in vain attempt to warm
them, the big, sulky-looking man put out a great
hand hardly cleaner, took the boy&rsquo;s blue fingers
between his palms, and held them there to warm
them. His grim face hardly relaxed, but the
kindliness of the act, and the queer mingling of
astonishment and pleasure on the child&rsquo;s face, made
the incident good to see.</p>

<p>Again, on Washington Street I passed a woman
in Quaker garb, who stood looking in at the window
of a jeweler. She regarded placidly, yet with
an inscrutable look, the gems on velvet cushions
within. What she was thinking it would not be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
easy to say; but what a delightful essay Charles
Lamb might have written &ldquo;On a Quakeress looking
in at a Jeweler&rsquo;s Window&rdquo;!</p>

<p>Half an hour later I passed the silk counter of
one of the large dry-goods stores. There a couple
of nuns were selecting a sumptuous white brocade,
examining it with an air serious and absorbed, and
yet subtilely suggestive of feminine delight in the
beauty of the stuff. What to them were the pomps
and vanities of this world that their taste should
be concerned in a purchase so incongruous? Did
they buy a new robe wherein the image of some
Madonna is to shine forth in splendor at the coming
Christmastide, or the garment which some
young novice shall wear at her mystic spousals
with the church, thenceforth to know no raiment
but the strait livery of the sisterhood?</p>

<p>I grant you that one does not chance upon three
things so suggestive as these in every trip down
town; but there is always something. Learn to
see and to hear. Seeing and hearing are more
matters of the brain than of eye and ear. Train
the mind to observe, and no less train it to phrase;
then the whole question of material is settled.
Exposition demands, of course, the exercise of
reason as well as of observation, but the two are
closely bound together; and the mind which is
trained to see is as sure to reason about what it
sees as the plant which thrusts its rootlets into rich
soil is to grow.</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII">XII</a></h2>

<p class="captitle">ARGUMENT</p>


<p>It is one of the most trying conditions of human
life that conviction is not proof. It is hard to be
brought face to face with the fact that the most
ardent belief does not make a thing true. We
have most of us known moments when it seemed
that there could be no justice in the universe because
some hope or some faith which we have
cherished with the whole soul was found after all
to be but a delusion. Truth in this world must
be tried not by desire but by reason; and we can
hardly be too careful in studying the processes by
which reason attempts its proofs.</p>

<p>Argument has been defined as the endeavor to
establish the truth or the falsity of an idea or a
proposition. Naturally a written argument is supposed
to be addressed to others, but the methods
used in constructing it are those which we employ
in examining a theory or a proposition in our own
minds. It is necessary to study these for the sake
of using them in composition; yet it is of no less
importance that we apply their principles to our
thinking. It may seem to you that I have a tendency
to treat English Composition as if it involved
the whole duty of man, but it is certainly true that
the advantages of familiarity with legal processes
may be very great, not only intellectually, but ethically.
Since conviction is not proof, either in
things emotional or things ethical any more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>in things intellectual, it follows that it is essential
to be provided with the means of testing the many
propositions and ideas which life puts before us.
It is not my intention to discuss Argument as a
means of spiritual advancement, yet it is not amiss
to call attention to its great value, even for one
who never intends to write at all.</p>

<p>Looking at Argument simply as a division of
composition, we need not have difficulty in perceiving
its importance. No intellectual necessity
is more common than that of endeavoring to make
others think or believe as we think or believe.
The effort to establish truth by argument is one
which from the dawn of civilization has occupied
the best powers of mankind. Openly, in avowed
reasoning, or covertly, in cunningly disguised forms,
those who write are constantly arguing for one
theory or another, for some idea, for some conviction.
The writer who is trained to the craft of
logic has the same advantage in discussion with
one who has not that a trained boxer has in an
encounter with a green hand.</p>

<p>It must be evident to any one that Argument is
closely allied to Exposition. Much discussion may
be resolved into a dispute over definitions, and when
thinkers disagree it is more often about terms than
about principles. It has happened before now that
men have gone to the stake upon a question whether
a thing in regard to which everybody was in substantial
accord should be called by one name or by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
another; and it is evident that Exposition may
sometimes be more effectively convincing than formal
Argument, since if a truth is clearly set forth
it is likely to carry conviction with it.</p>

<p>Macaulay&rsquo;s &ldquo;Machiavelli,&rdquo; which we have examined,
goes very near the line of Argument, since,
as has been said, it is essentially an endeavor to
prove that the vices of the Italians of the fifteenth
century were national rather than personal and
individual. Indeed, in perhaps the majority of
expositions of any complexity there is likely to be
an underlying basis of argument. It is difficult
to suppose a logical sequence of facts or ideas
which does not involve argumentative reasoning, at
least tacitly. Here, as everywhere in composition,
one form passes into another, and no arbitrary line
of division can be drawn. Exposition and Argument
are constantly united; and moreover it is
true that the latter is constantly given the guise of
the former, so that at first glance a chain of logical
reasoning is easily mistaken for a simple statement
of facts. To quote once more from the &ldquo;Machiavelli:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When war becomes the trade of a separate class,
the least dangerous course left to a government is to
form a standing army. It is scarcely possible that
men can pass their lives in the service of one state
without feeling some interest in its greatness. Its
victories are their victories. Its defeats are their defeats.
The contract loses something of its mercantile
character. The services of the soldier are considered
as the effects of patriotic zeal, his pay as the tribute of
national gratitude. To betray the power which employs
him, to be even remiss in its service, are in his
eyes the most atrocious and degrading of crimes.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>This is a complete argument, easily reducible to
logical terms. It opens with the proposition that
if war becomes a trade the nation should enlist
and control the army; and the remainder of the
paragraph is taken up with the proof of this statement.
It is not all expressed; but it may be said
to consist of three propositions supported as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>First: Men who make war a trade are likely to
betray a country.</p>

<p class="logic">Men likely to betray are a danger.</p>

<p class="logic">Hence, men who make war a trade are a danger.</p>

<p>Second: Men in standing army become identified
with the country.</p>

<p class="logic">Men identified with the country less likely to
betray.</p>

<p class="logic">Hence, men in standing army less likely to betray.</p>

<p>Third: Whatever most decreases chance of betrayal
is best.</p>

<p class="logic">To form standing army most decreases the
chance of betrayal.</p>

<p class="logic">Hence, to form standing army is best, or least
dangerous.</p>

<p>This illustrates how intricately interwoven is
Argument with other forms of composition, and
how easily one may overlook the fact that he is
reading or writing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Formally speaking, the difference between Exposition
and Argument is the difference between
peace and war. One is a hidden and the other an
avowed struggle. In Exposition the writer declares;
in Argument he defends. In the former
there is no necessary endeavor to convince. The
writer concerns himself with setting forth facts,
views, or theories; he nominally deals with statement
pure and simple. In the latter he attempts
to enforce assent to his proposition; to convince is
his declared and primary object. Exposition is the
teacher; Argument, the soldier.</p>

<p>The danger of Argument is that of all contest.
To make an effort to effect a given thing, to endeavor
to enforce a view, is of course to expose
one&rsquo;s self to the chance of arousing opposition. It
is to invite attack, and to run the risk of defeat.
For this reason it is necessary to use not a little
shrewdness in deciding whether it is best to put
what one has to say into the form of declared argument.
Often it is wiser to endeavor to produce
an exposition so clear that it shall carry with it the
conclusion which the writer desires to establish.
It is at least safe to assert that in writings meant
to convince, the more fully the appearance of not
arguing can be maintained the more satisfactory
will be the effect. The reader will certainly go as
far as he can be made to suppose himself and not
the author to be drawing conclusions. Most editorial
argumentative writing, and especially that
which deals with political questions, is almost of
necessity disguised in a semblance as close to Exposition
as possible. Where passion is aroused,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
prejudices excited, and the mind of the reader
armed against attempts to convince, whatever is
done must be done in a way calculated to soothe
rather than to excite.</p>

<p>When Argument avowed and formal is attempted,
no pains should be spared to make it
irresistible. Reasoning which does not succeed is
the strongest presumption against the proposition
it seeks to defend. Indeed, logic which fails seems
almost to establish the truth of the opposite proposition.
&ldquo;He that taketh the sword shall fall by
the sword,&rdquo; and he who advances an argument
must either prevail by it or fall altogether. The
proposition which before it is argued is viewed at
worst with indifference is discredited and disbelieved
when once an attempt to establish its credibility
has been made and has failed.</p>

<p>The strength of an argument lies in that quality
which is called logical accuracy. To cover the
whole subject of reasoning minutely it would be
necessary to go over the entire field of formal
logic; but here we must content ourselves with
considering points which are essential and which
pretty fairly cover the needs of argumentative composition
in a literary sense.</p>

<p>Before beginning a chain of reasoning it is wise
to fix what is named the burden of proof. In
other words it is well to decide how much one is
called upon to prove. It is important to know
whether the presumption lies for or against the
proposition at issue, to be clear what may be
assumed. In many cases this has no especial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
practical bearing, but it is well to be sure where
one stands. It is always easier to defend than to
attack, and in so far as a writer can put from him
the burden of proof, in so far he has rendered his
task lighter. The received theory and the existing
state of things have in their favor a presumption
which may be advanced by him who argues in
their favor and which must always be done away
with by him who reasons against them. The
writer who attacks civilization, for instance, who
decries the existing religion or the value of literature,
has upon him the burden of proof; while he
who defends them has the advantage of an affirmative
assumption. The former is called upon to
produce arguments to prove his claim; the latter
need do no more than to refute the reasoning of his
opponent. On the one hand it is a question of
attack; while on the other it is a matter of defense.</p>

<p>The first thing in establishing a line of argument
is to define clearly the proposition to be proved.
Nothing further can be done until the writer has
made the question at issue clear beyond all possibility
of mistake. It is necessary to force one&rsquo;s own
mind to an understanding so sharp and exact that
confusion is impossible. The most common failing
of mankind is mental ambiguity; and nothing is
more frequent than for writers to be entirely mistaken
in what they suppose themselves to mean.
The whole so-called Socratic method of reasoning&mdash;the
most teasingly irritating form of logic ever
devised; the Spanish-fly form of conviction&mdash;consists
chiefly in badgering an opponent into a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
realization of the fact that he does not know what
he is talking about; that he is entirely wrong in
his notion of his own meaning. The philosopher
who in these less patient days should devote himself
to questioning so vexing as that with which
Socrates is said to have roasted opponents in his
time would run imminent risk of a broken head;
but the class of illogical arguers against whom he
contended is with us to this day.</p>

<p>Once the proposition is clear in the mind, it is
necessary to find means to convey it to the understanding
of others; to convey it, be it remembered,
so that it shall arrive with meaning and sharpness
of outline unimpaired. It is the old question of
Clearness. An idea which leaves one mind with all
the beauty and symmetry of a snow-crystal often
gets to another mind as a mere formless drop of
snow-water. To the end that the proposition come
to the reader with the identity and form uninjured,
it is often needful to declare at the outset the sense
in which are used the words, terms, and phrases
which follow. The only sure way of dealing with
a doubtful case is to say plainly: &ldquo;When such
a word is introduced, it means exactly this.&rdquo; In
close writing such defining is almost always essential
to the success of the work. You may remember, as
an illustration, how Ruskin defines his terms at the
beginning of &ldquo;Modern Painters.&rdquo; In this way
only is it possible to avoid the pitfalls which the
varied meanings of the language spread for the
foot of the unwary. Some of the many possible
errors are dangerous, some easily detected. No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
one, for instance, need be fooled by a fallacy like
the following:&mdash;</p>

<p class="logic">An artist is an interpreter of the beautiful.</p>

<p class="logic">Mr. Rothschild&rsquo;s <i>chef</i> is an artist.</p>

<p class="logic">Hence, Mr. Rothschild&rsquo;s <i>chef</i> is an interpreter
of the beautiful.</p>

<p class="noindent">There may be those whose respect for gastronomy
is so high that they would not shrink from this conclusion,
but taking the argument as it stands, it is
evident that the word &ldquo;artist&rdquo; is used in a double
sense. In the first assertion it signifies one who
labors in what we call the fine arts; one gifted
with that incommunicable power of which we spoke
at the beginning of these talks. In the second assertion,
the word &ldquo;artist&rdquo; signifies one clever and
skillful in the practice of his profession.</p>

<p>To take a more serious illustration, the much
mooted question whether Walt Whitman is or is
not a poet can be argued only after an agreement
upon the sense in which &ldquo;poet&rdquo; is to be understood.
If &ldquo;poet&rdquo; means one who writes verse in metrical
forms, the proposition cannot be even discussed, because
the fact that Whitman did not write formal
metrical verse is admitted by everybody. If, on the
other hand, the term &ldquo;poet&rdquo; be extended to include
writers of imaginative and dithyrambic prose,
a discussion becomes almost inevitable. Most of
the magazine essays which nominally deal with the
question stated are really occupied chiefly with the
inquiry, &ldquo;What sense shall we give to the term
&lsquo;poet&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>It is true that the ordinary reader will often fail
to make a distinction of this sort. If he be told
that the point at issue is Whitman&rsquo;s poetic standing,
he will generally accept the statement, however
widely the discussion may depart from the
proposition. It might seem to follow that it is of
little consequence whether a writer is logical or
not; but it is always to be remembered that the fact
that a reader does not know by what means he is
impressed does not necessarily weaken the impression.
Indeed, it is probably true that those who
are least aware of the processes of literature are
often those most vividly affected by them. The
writer who has command of literary forms, who
understands clearly what he desires to do and how
it is best done, will reach and control the mind of
the reader, and need not be disturbed by the fact
that the latter does not in the least appreciate the
art which has seized and which holds him.</p>

<p>It is of the highest importance to keep in mind
when defining propositions or terms that the basis
of all discussion must be mutually accepted by
writer and reader. Until a starting-point where
these two are in accord is found, it is manifestly
idle to attempt to draw inferences. The writer
who argues with the view of convincing the general
public is forced to take as premises truth universally
allowed, and facts generally known or which
can be supported by easily convincing evidence.
He is at the outset met with the difficulty that words
are seldom free from ambiguity, and that fact and
fiction are as inextricably intertangled as are the
rootlets of two trees growing side by side. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
nicest judgment must be used in determining how
far any statement is admittedly true; not, be it
noted, how far it <i>is</i> true, but how far common consent
admits its verity. The premise of any argument
addressed to the general reader can go no
farther than general conviction goes. Even here
a writer is often hampered by the fact that the
sense of ambiguity is apt to cling to any question
concerning which there has been dispute. This
is especially true of subjects about which there
has been extensive controversy. It is admitted by
everybody, for instance, that there are things in
Scripture which are not to be accepted with absolute
literalness; yet to assume this in argument is
almost inevitably to arouse suspicion if not opposition.
No matter how carefully the writer endeavors
to keep within bounds of common belief, the
uncertainty and the doubt which belong to the
proposition in its extreme are apt to interfere with
its being given even the weight which it may deserve
when carefully guarded.</p>

<p>The best guides here are two: that homely,
domestic angel of the mind which we call common
sense, and the sincere desire to arrive at and to
establish the truth, as distinguished from eagerness
to win in argument. If a writer can divest himself
of a wish to prevail even if wrongfully, he has
increased tenfold his chance of winning rightly.
If he can bring his mind to the attitude of simple,
unsophisticated truth-seeking, without affectation
and without vanity, he is in the best possible condition
for arguing successfully. Enthusiasm tells
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
in this as in any other form of composition; but
Argument is primarily an appeal to the intellect,
and since the reason of the reader is aroused to
meet the logic advanced, the writer has need of all
his coolness and self-control in devising and arranging
his arguments.</p>

<p>The choice of the line of proof which is to be
employed is one of the most delicate matters connected
with this form of composition. If one undertakes
to convince, it is evident that no means which
may secure conviction should be slighted; and it is
of importance to select the train of reasoning along
which the mind of the reader will move with the
least opposition. Here advice cannot avail much.
The student must depend upon care, good judgment,
and practice, with the study and analysis
of the masterpieces of reasoning. The choice of
methods in arguing is the selection of the order
of battle; on it depends much of the success alike
of attack and of defense.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>The sense of the proposition, the meaning of the
terms, and the line of argument having been determined,
they must be held to firmly to the end. No
defect in disputation is more common than that of
shifting ground. Sometimes, especially in debate,
this is deliberate. A clever dialectician, one who
is able deftly to twist words to varied uses and to
turn phrases about, has little difficulty, if he finds
himself cornered, in altering his position completely.
He easily confuses the terms so that the point at
issue is changed. He raises a cloud of phrases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
under cover of which his attack is shifted to another
quarter, as a line of battle is sometimes altered behind
a cloud of smoke. This is less often possible
in written conflict than in oral, yet there it may
sometimes be done. It is at best, however, merely
a temporization. What is set down in &ldquo;the cold
permanence of print&rdquo; may be examined until its
inaccuracies are brought to light. The swiftness
of speech and the glamour of personal persuasiveness
will cover fallacies which could avail nothing
if put upon paper. Any change of position, moreover,
is a confession of weakness; and once it is
observed, the effect of the entire chain of reasoning
is weakened, if not destroyed altogether.</p>

<p>A change of base in argument is the result of
deliberate intention less often than of mental confusion.
Few of us realize how seldom we think
clearly; how much more rarely we think clearly
and consecutively; and how most rare it is that we
think clearly, consecutively, and logically. Much
training is required to bring the mind to the power
of holding fast to a single issue in discussion, of
persisting in a single line of proof, of resisting all
temptations to turn to side issues.</p>

<p>Nor is this solely from a lack of intellectual
power; it is in part due to an instinctive desire
to escape unwelcome results. One of the surest
indications of a firm and well-disciplined mind is
that it does not shrink from its own conclusions.
The natural, human tendency is to escape from a
distasteful result of investigation or reasoning by
assuming that the process must be wrong because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the decision arrived at is unpleasant. Yet to dislike
a proposition is not to disprove it. To protest
against the fact established by sound logic no more
destroys it than the wail of a child brings down
from heaven the round yellow moon for which he
cries. All intellectual growth and all character
stand upon the willingness of the mind to accept
and to act upon the conclusions at which it arrives
by the exercise of its best reasoning powers. It is
much to be able to think; it is more to dare to
think; but it is most of all to be able to accept
without shrinking or evasion the results of thought,
whether one&rsquo;s own or others&rsquo;.</p>

<p class="captitle">ARGUMENTATIVE FORM</p>


<p>It is proper and perhaps even important that the
student shall learn the distinction which is made by
logicians between reasoning which is inductive and
that which is deductive. As a matter of practical
work in the writing of arguments, the distinction
is of less importance than might seem from the
formality with which these terms are treated; but
as Induction and Deduction are words which the
true logician cannot mention without at least a
seeming impulse to cross himself, it is well to
know what the difference is.</p>

<p>Induction, then, is reasoning from the particular
to the general; the establishment of an hypothesis
by showing that the facts agree with it. It is
preëminently the scientific method. By observing
natural phenomena, the scientist conceives what
the law which governs them must be. This idea
of the general principle is then the hypothesis
which he attempts to prove; and his method is
to examine the facts under all conditions possible,
establishing his proposition by showing that the
facts are in accord with it.</p>

<p>Deduction is the converse of this, and consists
in drawing out particular truths from general ones.
A universal proposition may be regarded as a
bundle in which are bound together many individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
ones. It is the work of deduction to take these
out,&mdash;to separate any one of them from the rest.
The general truth, &ldquo;All metals are elements,&rdquo; includes
in it the especial truths, &ldquo;Iron is an element,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Gold is an element,&rdquo; and so on for each
metal which could be named. Deduction is the
process of separating one of these from the whole.
Speaking broadly, scientific reasoning is more
likely to be inductive, while other reasoning is
more likely to be deductive.</p>

<p>As a matter of practical composition, Argument
is the statement of a proposition, and the arrangement
of the proofs which the writer believes will
establish its truth. The essential matter is to
begin with some truth or fact generally acknowledged,
and to lead the mind of the reader on by
deductions which cannot be disputed, until the proposition
to be proved is reached as an unassailable
conclusion.</p>

<p>This process may be very simple, or extremely
complex; the steps may be slight, or they may be,
like the platforms of the pyramids, barely scalable.
In discussing methods, it is necessary to use some
technical expressions which it is well to define:&mdash;</p>

<p>A Term is a word or combination of words used
to name some thing or idea in reasoning.</p>

<p>A Proposition is a statement of the relation between
two terms.</p>

<p>If we say, &ldquo;The man is a patriot,&rdquo; we have a
sentence in which is a statement of the relation
between the thing &ldquo;man&rdquo; and the thing &ldquo;patriot.&rdquo;
This is therefore a proposition. Here the terms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
are &ldquo;man&rdquo; and &ldquo;patriot,&rdquo; because these are the
names of the things of which we speak in reasoning.</p>
<p>We might now make another proposition, this
time general, and say, &ldquo;A patriot is a valuable
citizen.&rdquo; Here the terms are &ldquo;patriot&rdquo; and &ldquo;valuable
citizen,&rdquo; and the proposition asserts a relation
between them.</p>

<p>If these two propositions are examined, they are
found to have in common the term &ldquo;patriot,&rdquo; and
it is seen to be possible to draw from them another
proposition. If the man of whom mention is made
is a patriot, and a patriot is a valuable citizen, it is
evident enough that the man must be a valuable
citizen. It is merely an application of the principle
that things which are equal to the same thing
are equal to each other. And this brings us to a
third definition:&mdash;</p>

<p>A Syllogism is a group of three propositions, of
which, if the first two are true, the third must follow
as a deduction from them.</p>

<p>A complete syllogism has just been given: The
man is a patriot; a patriot is a valuable citizen;
hence the man is a valuable citizen.</p>

<p>It is possible to draw a third proposition only
from two that have one term in common. It follows
that there are three terms in a syllogism,&mdash;the
first and second propositions having one term
alike, and each having a particular term which
reappears in the third proposition. This third
proposition is that which the endeavor is made to
prove. To establish a proposition by syllogism,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
then, it is necessary to find two others which contain
each one of its terms, and which have a term
in common. It is necessary to add that not from
every pair of propositions which contain a common
term is it possible to draw a third, and thus to
form a syllogism. If we say, &ldquo;A rose is a flower,&rdquo;
&ldquo;A lily is a flower,&rdquo; we have two propositions
which have a common term, yet we cannot go on
to make the third proposition, &ldquo;Hence a rose is a
lily.&rdquo; The term which is common to both propositions
must in one of them be spoken of as a whole,
or in a general way. Logicians say that it must
be &ldquo;distributed;&rdquo; in other words, one assertion
must cover the term in its entire extent. In the
first syllogism which we examined, the common&mdash;it
is usually called the &ldquo;middle&rdquo;&mdash;term is in
the second proposition spoken of in a general way.
&ldquo;A patriot is a valuable citizen&rdquo; is an assertion of
all patriots. In the false syllogism, &ldquo;A rose is a
flower; a lily is a flower,&rdquo; there is nothing said of
all flowers, and yet &ldquo;flower&rdquo; is the middle term.
The rose is one flower, the lily is one flower, but
until there is something said of all flowers it is not
possible to draw out a new conclusion,&mdash;to form a
syllogism.</p>

<p>He who wishes to exercise his wits with pretty
mental gymnastics may learn from books on logic
that there are a great many varieties of syllogisms.
There are twenty-four valid ones, and a crowd of
poor relatives, which exist under the discrediting
title, &ldquo;imperfect syllogisms,&rdquo; and which, paradoxically,
are of no use until they have been &ldquo;reduced.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
When it is added that each has a fine
Latin name, the reader may appreciate that he is
here being spared a good deal.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>Although it is not possible to take space for a
very intricate example of the skeleton of an argument,
it is hardly fair to give nothing more complex
than a simple syllogism; and the following
may assist the formation of a more clear conception
of the form in which reasoning should be put.
Suppose the proposition which is to be proved
to be, &ldquo;The Norsemen discovered America before
Columbus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Taking a few of the more obvious arguments
which might be advanced in support of this proposition,
and arranging them so as to begin with the
more generally allowed and easily proved, we have:</p>

<p>
1. The frequent appearance in European literature before Columbus of
allusions to a land across the sea.
</p>

<p>
2. The story in the Icelandic Sagas.
</p>

<p>
3. Norse remains in America.
</p>

<p>These proofs will be sufficient for purposes of
illustration. Let us examine them in detail a
little. Under each of these proofs&mdash;which it is
convenient to call subordinate propositions&mdash;lies a
syllogism, whether it is fully stated or not. The
writer must be entirely clear in his own mind what
this is, whether it seem to him well to state it explicitly
or not. Here the syllogism of the first
subordinate proposition, briefly stated, is:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Allusions to a land over sea prove knowledge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>of such a land.</p>

<p>In pre-Columbian literature are allusions to
land over sea.</p>

<p>Hence there must have been knowledge of
such a land.</p></div>

<p>This brings us face to face with the necessity of
supporting premises with facts. To support the
first sub-proposition there must be citations from
pre-Columbian literature. This is a mere matter
of research. One reason for putting this especial
proof first is that in supporting it it is possible
to begin with facts which cannot be questioned.
It is true that the very next step will bring us
upon doubtful territory, but we start from firm
ground. The moment that the passages are quoted,
the possibility occurs to the mind that they may
be taken to refer to lands then known, or as the
expression of mythical fancies. These objections
must be met. An argument can no more pass an
unanswered objection than a locomotive can cross
a bridge from which a span is missing. Reasons
must here be given for connecting with the New
World the passages cited. It will be no less important
to show the reasons for supposing that the
information which the ancient writers possessed of
the New World came from the Norsemen. The
rest may all be allowed, and yet be held to have no
bearing on the thing to be proved, so that this link
in the chain must be made strong and evident.</p>

<p>This last point illustrates the sort of questions
which are likely to arise in regard to arrangement.
Is it well to introduce here the proofs that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
knowledge of another continent came from the
Norse, or would it be better to wait until the Icelandic
Sagas have been spoken of? In the latter
case, the parts of the argument may be more closely
bound together, and it gives an air of fairness to the
whole when the writer is willing to go back a good
way in his argument to take up possible objections
and answer them. Against this is to be balanced
the possibility that the reader may be put into a
suspicious state of mind by finding that a doubtful
point is passed over, and so be less easily convinced
than he otherwise might be. The writer of an
argument must consider these things, and upon the
good judgment with which he settles such questions
much of his success depends.</p>

<p>In this first sub-proposition there is no need of
stating formally the syllogism involved, since, if
the first or major premise is successfully defended,
the rest follows obviously. As a matter of practical
arrangement, then, the sub-proposition and its
defense might stand in this order:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The discovery of America by the Norsemen
is proved by the allusions in pre-Columbian literature
to a land over sea.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Citation of passages.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Proofs that these do not refer to the Eastern
Hemisphere.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Proofs that they are not mythical allusions.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Proofs that they do refer to America.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Proofs that the knowledge shown came from
Norsemen.</p>

<p>When these points are established, the first sub-proposition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
with its underlying syllogism, may be
looked upon as proved, and the next may be taken
up. I have not studied the question of the discovery
of America by the Norsemen closely enough to
know that the line of proof given is the best possible,
but it serves well enough to illustrate the general
form of the skeleton of an argument. Each
of the subordinate propositions must be divided
and subdivided if necessary, until the divisions can
be handled easily and proved conclusively; and
the writer will do well to test the strength of his
argument by making a complete chain of the syllogisms
involved, seeing which rests upon another, so
that the arrangement may be conformed to principles
of natural sequence.</p>

<p>One important matter in reasoning is never to
claim too much. Care must be taken not to put
upon a proof a greater strain than it will bear. It
is also an obvious rule that it is wise to insist upon
no more than is absolutely needed to establish the
proposition in hand. Sometimes it is wise to indicate
that more might be proved, but in general the
assent of the reader is to be treated as a bank account
to be drawn upon as far as it is necessary,
but in no case beyond the actual need of the occasion.
It is well never to waste strength in proving
more than is essential, and always to avoid a side
issue as one shuns a road leading to sure destruction.
Often it is a wise device in argumentation
to establish a point and leave the reader to perceive
its import. Here as everywhere a thing which the
reader is led to do for himself is a hundred fold
more effective than anything which can be done or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
said for him. The phrase, &ldquo;Is it not possible that
these facts prove this?&rdquo; has won more converts
than the boldest assertion: &ldquo;These proofs make
it impossible to doubt.&rdquo; Man that is born of woman
is born to obstinacy as the sparks fly upward,
and if he be assured that he cannot or shall not
doubt, he is apt to begin to doubt from simple contrariety.
Yet it will not do to run any risk of
leaving the reader in doubt as to what has been
established by the arguments given. It is often
necessary to insist that a proposition is proved. A
victory is hardly recognized as a victory until the
trumpets are blown, and an argument is scarcely
concluded without some sort of a declaration of
success.</p>

<p>Where the line is to be drawn between the extreme
of leaving to the reader the perception of
what is proved and that of insisting that a demonstration
has been made must depend upon the audience
addressed. The writer of an argument has
especial need to be sure to whom he speaks. He
must consider the knowledge of his audience, their
views, and especially their prejudices. It is in relation
to the last that there comes into play what
it has been the fashion to call Persuasion. Although
Argument is an appeal to the intellect, there
are few chains of reasoning which fail to appeal
also to the emotions. It is hardly possible to conceive
of a discussion which will not to a greater or
less degree touch the passions of those addressed.
Much is effected by keeping in mind the natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
prejudices of the reader, and so framing arguments
that they shall appeal directly to the emotions by
the personal or selfish nature of their deductions.
An illustration is to be found in political harangues,
which, while nominally devoted to proving
the wisdom or advisability of some party measure,
are really only clever attempts to convince that the
measure is for the personal advantage of voters.
This is, of course, the abuse of this form of argument.
The legitimate use of this appeal to the
passions is in the putting of reasoning sound and
wholesome in itself into a form which shall captivate
the hearer or reader. It is the lavishing upon
the composition of all the graces of manner, of
style, of ornament, which the writer can compass,
to the end that the reader shall be attracted and
inclined to accept the conclusions set down. Stevenson
speaks of a somewhat different matter in
words which are strictly applicable here:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whatever be the obscurities, whatever the intricacies
of the argument, the neatness of the fabric must not
suffer, or the artist has been proved unequal to his design.
And, on the other hand, no form of words must
be selected, no knot must be tied among the phrases,
unless knot and word be precisely what is wanted to
forward and illuminate the argument; for to fail in
this is to swindle in the game.&mdash;<i>Cont. Rev.</i>, vol.
xlvii. (1885), p. 551.</p></div>

<p>Almost as often as with the establishment of our
own reasoning, are we concerned in argument with
endeavors to overthrow the logic of an opponent.
Frequently it is necessary to refute views opposed
to that which is being put forward. It is in general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
wise not to bring this in too soon. It is well
to predispose the reader in favor of the conclusion
to be defended, and then to take up contrary
opinions. Sometimes a broad statement at the beginning
to the effect that objections exist is politic;
and in any case it is important that there
be no slightest appearance of shirking or evading
the issue. When the writer is conscious that the
weight of popular sentiment or general opinion is
against him, he may sometimes command attention
and provoke interest by boldly plunging at once
into an attack upon commonly received theories.
Audacity always commands attention, and if it be
reinforced by ability it is no less sure of admiration.
A striking example of this method is to be
found in Colonel Ingersoll&rsquo;s attacks upon the Bible
and religion. However one may be shocked by
his violations of good taste, and whether one does
or does not agree with his methods or his conclusions,
it is impossible to deny his success as a
speaker. The very boldness with which he has
attacked has insured a hearing. This form of discussion
calls for dash, courage, and confidence,&mdash;and
it is sometimes the result of sheer impudence.
Only he who has great powers and perfect command
of them can reasonably hope to succeed here.</p>

<p>For answering the arguments of others, and indeed
for the proper examination of one&rsquo;s own, it is
necessary to give attention to the numerous fallacies
which may creep into reasoning, by design or
by accident. These are to be completely mastered
only by the minute study of logic; but some are so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
common that they should be considered here.</p>

<p>The first fallacy is that of the confusion of terms,
such as that found in the attempt to prove the <i>chef</i>
to be an interpreter of the beautiful, or in the
question whether Whitman was a poet.</p>

<p>The second fallacy which in practical writing it
is well to be on guard against is the <i>non sequitur</i>.
There is much advanced as argument&mdash;as for instance
in political editorials&mdash;where consecutiveness
is confounded with causality. <i>Post hoc ergo
propter hoc</i> is the phrase which sums this up:
After this, therefore because of this. &ldquo;We shall
die after eating this meal, therefore this meal is
the cause of our death,&rdquo; is an example of this fallacy.
Put in this way the absurdity is evident;
but a genuine fallacy, lurking under words as the
conventional serpent of school-girl compositions
and of temperance orators lurks beneath flowers,
is a different thing. Here is part of an editorial
from one of the leading New York daily journals:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The vote of Senator X. is a striking illustration
of the power of money among the law-makers of this
great nation. The vigorous and unscrupulous support
which has been given to this bill by Mr. A., the western
billionaire, is known to everybody; and equally
well known is the fact that hitherto Senator X. has
been counted among the stanch opposers of the iniquitous
measure. Senator X. is known to have had a
private interview with Mr. A. on the evening before
the vote was taken, and the result was evident when
next morning the Senator gave his support to the bill
which he had before steadily opposed.</p></div>

<p>In the especial case to which this refers there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
may or there may not have been bribery; but it is
well to bear in mind that this editorial proves nothing.
It amounts merely to saying that the vote
happened after the interview and was therefore the
result of it; so that it is in reality one of those
fallacies which in a simpler form appear so absurd.
Yet readers in abundance accept this sort of thing
as proof, especially when political prejudice inclines
them to believe it. It would seem that a little
common sense and a little care in examination were
all that could be needed to dispose of specious
errors of this class, yet they every day prevail.</p>

<p>The third fallacy is that of analogy. Analogy
proves a probability, but it cannot establish a certainty.
If a young woman has refused a dozen
suitors, it is manifestly absurd to say that this
proves that she will be equally unkind to the thirteenth.
Politicians reason by analogy that a State
which hitherto has gone Republican or Democratic
may be counted upon to give a majority for its
old party; when, lo, a change comes suddenly, and
the conclusion is found to be false. That we have
always liked the novels of a certain author does not
insure that we shall be pleased with his next; that
the sun has always risen does not prove that it will
rise to-morrow morning; that men have from time
immemorial been born with one head does not
prove that a child may not be born with two,&mdash;as
testify the freaks of dime museums. It is
true that analogy often establishes a probability so
strong that it amounts to a moral certainty. We
are justified in acting upon the assumption that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the sun will rise to-morrow, and in assuming that
any given child of whose birth we hear has but one
head. It is important in arguing, however, to bear
in mind the difference, whether in one&rsquo;s own reasoning
or in that of an opponent, between analogy
and absolute proof. Things which are like the
same thing are like each other; but things that
are like the same thing are not necessarily equal
to each other.</p>

<p>The practical rules which may be given for the
writing of Argument are chiefly recapitulations of
what has been said.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> Begin with clear understanding and clear
statement of proposition and of terms.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> Plan argument with reference to the especial
point to be established and to the audience to be
addressed.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> Proceed generally from the more obvious to
the less clear, and from the weaker to the stronger
proof.</p>

<p><i>d.</i> Be acutely alive to fallacies in any reasoning
which is to be refuted, but to fallacies in your own
work no less.</p>

<p><i>e.</i> Never force a proposition or a proof beyond
its value.</p>

<p><i>f.</i> Concede all side issues and irrelevant matters
if by so doing you do not lessen the chain of reasoning
in points really important, and especially if
in so doing you can foster a disposition favorable
to your position.</p>

<p><i>g.</i> Always remember that assertion is not argument.</p>

<p>To these rules might not inappropriately be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
added the saying of Sophocles: &ldquo;Truth is always
the strongest argument.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>The practical application of Argument to literary
work is not difficult to discover. The most obvious
use of this sort of composition is in the plea of the
lawyer, the editorials of the newspaper, the essay
establishing scientific theories, literary opinions, or
the like. Whoever writes at all, however, even if
it be but in simple private correspondence, is sure
to employ Argument sooner or later, and to a
greater or less degree. It may be in defense of a
friend, the justification of one&rsquo;s own acts, in proving
the value of a new invention, supporting political
or scientific views, in urging a particular line
of investment,&mdash;in short, in any one of a thousand
different ways. In one shape or another, reasoning
comes constantly into play. He is merely a &ldquo;mush
of concession&rdquo; who never attempts to bring another
to his way of thinking. Indeed, he who does not
endeavor to make others think as he thinks may be
suspected of never thinking at all. Life is a continuous
conflict, the strife for the survival of the
fittest. The instinct to make our opinions prevail
is in the blood of the meekest. Civilization differs
from barbarism chiefly in that the strife has become
intellectual instead of physical; and intellectual
conflict is but another name for Argument. Since
our lot is cast in a civilized state of society, to
neglect this form of composition is to neglect the
manual of arms of the battalion in which Fate has
enrolled us!</p>

<p class="captitle">DESCRIPTION</p>


<p>Description is at once the most common and the
most difficult of the varieties of composition. It is
apparently a thing which nobody fears to undertake,
while it is certainly one which only a master
is able to do really well. Everybody attempts it,
yet there are probably in literature fewer fully successful
descriptions than there are examples of any
other sort of writing whatever.</p>

<p>A description is an endeavor to call up before
the mind of the reader a picture of the thing described.
Nothing is easier than to make a catalogue
of things which one has seen; to schedule the
details of a landscape, the particulars of a building,
a room or a person. To convey a clear and
accurate idea of the whole is most difficult. The
untrained writer is apt to make of his attempts at
description a mere running memorandum of points
which he remembers in a scene. He sets down a
list of matters more or less important, not because
he can thus make the whole vivid and real to the
reader, but because they are true. The result is
that he has forced the truth to convey a falsehood&mdash;if
indeed it be made to convey anything intelligible.</p>

<p>No student can go far in the examination of any
of the arts without discovering that the object of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
expression is not so much to tell the truth as to
produce an impression of truth. The literal truth
may easily give a false impression, and becomes in
that case the most vicious of falsehoods of which
art is capable, just as the telling of facts with intent
to deceive is the most dangerous form of lying.
The thing to be sought is not accuracy of statement,
but accuracy of perception, and the means
must be subordinated to the effect.</p>

<p>It follows that even more vitally important than
that all details be true, is that they be significant;
that they not only appeal to the memory
or the reason of the writer, but that they have a
creative effect upon the mind of the reader. The
author may remember that all the things which he
sets down are true, yet it may be that all which
he writes is false in its result. In morals it is
fitting that we give credit for good intentions, no
matter what the result of them may be; in authorship
the intention is of no consequence whatever.
The result is the only thing to be taken into account.
Here to fail is to fail, whether one meant
well or ill; and from this there is no escape.</p>

<p>I am of course keeping strictly to the definition
of Description which has been given. In that
form of Exposition which is frequently called Description,
the giving a scientific or practical account
of a thing, accuracy of detail is of the first importance.
If one is called upon to &ldquo;describe&rdquo; a machine,
it is not usually meant that he shall try to
present to the mind a picture of it, but that he
shall expound it. This is not Description in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
literary sense, and with this we have nothing now
to do. In the sense in which the term is used as
naming a department of composition, Description
is not scientific, but emotional; not categorical, but
literary; not intellectual, so much as visual. The
description of a landscape falls short of its intent
just so far as it fails to call up before the inner eye
the image which was before the mind of the writer,&mdash;save
in so far as from the nature of language
any word-picture must fall short. If a passage designed
to paint a scene does not make the reader
seem actually to see that scene it cannot be held
that the author has fulfilled his intention.</p>

<p>It must be recognized once and for all that
words cannot really paint. No artificer can labor
intelligently until he has learned not only the possibilities
but also the limitations of the means at
his disposal. In writing it is important to remember
what words cannot do as well as what they can
effect. The most that the writer can hope to do is
to revive in the mind of the reader images which
the latter has seen. In speaking of the limitations
of language in the first of these talks, I reminded
you that when we read the description of a landscape
we construct an image out of material already
in the mind. Words cannot paint; that is the
province of another art. The painter is able to
present fresh forms, colors, combinations, new
landscapes, strange and unknown figures, and all
varieties of visual novelty. The writer must content
himself with a reawakening and a rearrangement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
of forms, figures, colors, images, already in
the reader&rsquo;s mind. His effect of novelty must come
from fresh and untried combinations; from
the vividness with which he is able to arouse these
remembered images until they appear so real as to
seem new.</p>

<p>It easily follows that the writer who understands
his art will cunningly avail himself of images which
are likely to be stored in the minds of his readers.
It is the same principle which directs us to appeal
to common emotions, to the general experiences
of mankind.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Let us examine a little this extract
from an account of a walk in the woods in England:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;Looking between the trees, I saw a little circular
glade, two or three score feet across. It was covered
with soft, thin grass, speckled with palely blue scabiosas,
and set round with tall, slender trees. On one
side was a strange imitation of the great trilith at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Stonehenge, formed by two tall boulders across which
had fallen the trunk of a large beech tree.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In America the reader might not know what
scabiosas are, but as this was written in England,
where, in some parts at least, the pale blue blossoms
of the flower are common in every field, the
audience addressed would probably not be puzzled
by this word. It is to be supposed that even there,
however, there would be many who would fail to
feel any force in the phrase &ldquo;the great trilith at
Stonehenge.&rdquo; A few might have seen it, and
others might be familiar with pictures representing
it; but the chance of finding this image in the mind
of the reader was so small as to render its use at
least ill-advised; and especially so as the comparison
is that of a trifling thing to a great one. The
reader who recalled Stonehenge would be likely to
feel that there was small excuse for likening a tree
trunk tumbled across a couple of boulders to the
magnificent and mysterious monuments of Salisbury
Plain.</p>

<p>An example of the fact that even in dealing
with the supernatural a writer has no resource save
images already known may be found in any story
dealing with the weird. Take this from Rudyard
Kipling&rsquo;s tale, &ldquo;The Return of Imray,&rdquo; where the
spirit of a murdered man is haunting the house:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We were alone in the house, but none the less it
was too fully occupied by a tenant with whom I did
not wish to interfere. I never saw him, but I could
see the curtain between the rooms quivering where
he had just passed through; I could hear the chairs
creaking as the bamboos sprung under a weight that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
had just quitted them; and I could feel when I went to
get a book from the dining-room that somebody was
waiting in the shadows of the front veranda till I should
have gone away.</p></div>

<p>This is perhaps not one of Mr. Kipling&rsquo;s happiest
passages, since it insists somewhat too strongly
upon the corporeal bulk of the phantom, but it
illustrates the point which we are considering.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>Of the greatest importance in Description is the
point of view. First there is the question of the
physical point of view. The writer must know
certainly and clearly at what point he has placed
the reader to look at the landscape, the person, or
the scene which is described. In the first lecture
I quoted the description which opens Kingsley&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Westward Ho!&rdquo; There the point of view is
that of one approaching the &ldquo;little white town of
Bideford,&rdquo; but there is at the very outset a violation
of propriety which injures the force of the
whole. &ldquo;The little white town of Bideford,&rdquo; the
author says, &ldquo;which slopes upward from its broad
tide-river paved with yellow sands, and many-arched
old bridge where salmon wait for Autumn
floods.&rdquo; The &ldquo;yellow sands&rdquo; and the salmon are
details which are known to one familiar with the
town, but they are not apparent to the stranger,
they are not evident from the point of view chosen,
and their introduction at once confuses the impression.</p>

<p>Goethe, who was keenly alive to all the details
of literary workmanship, commented upon a passage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
in Scott which violates the point of view. In
talking with Eckermann he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>It is a peculiarity of Walter Scott&rsquo;s that his great talent
in representing details often leads him into faults.
Thus in &ldquo;Ivanhoe,&rdquo; there is a scene where they are
seated at a table in a castle-hall, at night, and a stranger
enters. Now, he is quite right in describing the
stranger&rsquo;s appearance and dress, but it is a fault that he
goes to the length of describing his feet, shoes, and
stockings. When we sit down in the evening and some
one comes in, we notice only the upper part of his body.
If I describe the feet, daylight enters at once, and the
scene loses its nocturnal character.&mdash;March 11, 1831.</p></div>

<p>The point of view may of course be progressive.
The reader may be led on through a landscape or
through the rooms of a house, for instance. In
this it is necessary to keep clearly in mind and to
make evident to the reader every alteration in the
point of sight. Properly used, this method may be
very effective; but the least vagueness inevitably
leads to confusion. No description can be successful
if there is any uncertainty in regard to the
station of observation. The reader must know
where he is looking from as well as what he is
at. He may not, it is true, realize this, but the
writer must realize it for him.</p>

<p>What has been said of the physical point of
view may be applied to the emotional. The feeling
of the spectator influences the impression made
upon him by that at which he looks. Do not forget
the mood in which you expect your reader to
see the mental picture which you are endeavoring
to present. If you introduce into the midst of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
highly wrought and exciting tale a description of
a scene so closely connected with the narrative
that it is important for the reader to see it clearly,
you have to consider that if you have the hold you
should have upon him he is aroused by the story,
and will look with quickened eyes upon the view
your words present. You may therefore give him,
quickly and sharply, details such as imprint themselves
on the brain in moments of excitement. The
principle is one so obvious as hardly to need further
illustration; but it is not to be looked upon
as of small importance because small space is here
given to it.</p>

<p>Much modern description may be said to be entirely
emotional, in the sense that it aims rather to
produce the emotions aroused by a scene than to
picture the scene in its physical aspect. A recognition
of the difficulty of presenting a visual image
has brought this about, just as it has brought about
the discarding of the old-time fashion of cataloguing
details. The modern heroine, for instance, is
seldom described by the best novelists. Two or
three characteristic particulars are generally considered
sufficient to suggest the whole, or one touch
is cunningly added to another in the body of the
narrative, so that the image is formed almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>It is convenient to consider Description as being
of two sorts, although no sharp line can be drawn
between them. One method may be called Direct
Description, and the other Suggestive Description.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>The names indicate the distinction,&mdash;an attempt
to call up a picture by the enumeration directly of
the characteristics of an object or a scene, or to
suggest it by an imaginative figure. The former
is the simpler, the more common, the less subtle.
The difference between these sorts of description
may perhaps be appreciated by contrasting two
passages, the first from Shelley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mont Blanc,&rdquo;
and the second from Coleridge&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hymn before
Sunrise in the Vale of Chamouni.&rdquo; Shelley, dealing
directly with his subject, and enumerating actual
features of the scene, writes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus thou, Ravine of Arve&mdash;dark, deep Ravine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou many-colored, many-voicèd vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over whose pines and crags and caverns sail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast cloud-shadows and sunbeams.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Coleridge, on the other hand, suggests a picture
rather than gives one directly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hast thou a charm to stay the morning star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his steep course? So long he seems to pause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On thy bald, awful head, O sovran Blanc!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">In the one case there is a statement of particulars,
and from these separate features the reader is expected
to build up the scene before his mental
vision. In the other there is merely a suggestion
of the morning star hovering lingeringly over the
snowy, awe-inspiring crest of the mighty mountain.
It seems to me that in this especial instance Coleridge,
for once at least, has the better of Shelley,
and that the implied picture is more vivid
and effective than the picture more carefully elaborated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>To take an illustration from prose, let us contrast
the description which Dickens gives of Sairey
Gamp with that of Mrs. Fezziwig. Of the former
he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>She was a fat old woman, this Mrs. Gamp, with
a husky voice and a moist eye, which she had a remarkable
power of turning up and only showing the
white of it.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
Having very little neck, it cost her some
trouble to look over herself, if one may say so, at those
to whom she talked. She wore a very rusty gown,
rather the worse for snuff, and a shawl and bonnet to
correspond&hellip;. The face of Mrs. Gamp&mdash;the nose
in particular&mdash;was red and swollen; and it was difficult
to enjoy her society without becoming conscious of
a smell of spirits.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Of the other lady Dickens merely remarks:&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>In came Mrs. Fezziwig, one vast substantial smile.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Good as the former of these descriptions is of its
kind, it seems to me that if this were all that we
were told about these two characters, we should
have in the mind a more distinct picture of Mrs.
Fezziwig than of Mrs. Gamp. One is not obliged
to share this opinion, however, to appreciate the
difference between the two methods.</p>

<p>In Direct Description, the first thing to be considered,
after the point of view is selected, is what
is the central idea of the picture which is to be
produced. It is apt to be the fact that from a
description the reader gets one clear and vivid
impression to which all else is subordinate, and
beside which all else is comparatively vague. It is
therefore often wise to put all the real stress upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the points to be accented, leaving the reader to
imagine the rest.</p>

<p>The matter of selecting the central thought is
of the more weight, since it is important that this
be given clearly to the reader at its first presentation.
Whoever has tried to alter a mental image
knows how difficult it is to change a picture which
is already defined in the imagination. If the mind
in constructing a picture has conceived of a mountain
as standing on the right, and afterward finds
that the author intended it to be on the left, it is
on the right that that mountain is likely to remain
in the ideal landscape. I have always been a little
troubled by the fact that in his description at the
commencement of &ldquo;The Merry Men,&rdquo; Stevenson,
careful and exquisite artist though he was, speaks
of the &ldquo;great granite rocks that &hellip; go down
together in troops into the sea, like cattle on a
summer&rsquo;s day;&rdquo; and then, a little later, declares
that &ldquo;on calm days you can go wandering between
them in a boat for hours, echoes following you
about the labyrinth.&rdquo; From the comparison to
cattle, I always get the idea of boulders much
smaller than the second sentence shows to have
been intended. The readjustment is an unpleasant
break which jars upon the reality of the whole.</p>

<p>In the first example which I gave you, we are
told that the writer saw a glade, covered with soft,
thin grass, speckled with flowers. It is added that
the glade was set round with trees, and then that on
one side were a couple of tall boulders, across which
had fallen a large beech tree. This does not seem
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the natural or the effective order. The eye would
first notice that the glade was set about with trees,
next that there was the large fallen tree, lying
across the boulders, and only after this see that
the ground was covered with flower-spotted, thin
grass.</p>

<p>Here is another example which illustrates the
same error:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Vervain saw before him a rude mob, armed with
all sorts of improvised weapons. They had evidently
caught up scythes, bill-hooks, axes, or whatever came
first to hand. In the midst of them his eye distinguished
Henley and Western, and they were all led
by a large, coarse man with a red cap, who seemed to
have some authority over them. They were marshaled
into a rude order, the lines being wavering and uneven,
and all were evidently fiercely excited.</p></div>

<p>The author speaks first of a &ldquo;rude mob,&rdquo; a phrase
which calls up a formless and confused mass of
men. We are next told that in the midst the spectator
recognized two acquaintances, then that there
was a leader, and after that that the crowd was
moving in rude order, with uneven lines. This
last statement forces the reader to alter, if he can,
his first impression, and instead of imagining a
confused crowd, to think of a company irregularly
organized. If the writer had really seen in his
own mind the thing of which he wrote, he would in
the first place have spoken of the mob as a company
led by a leader conspicuous in his red cap,
and marching in wavering lines. After this he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
would have been conscious of the rough and improvised
weapons, and only after all these things
had forced themselves upon his attention would
there have been any recognition of individuals.</p>

<p>To select the central idea it is generally safe to
consider what one&rsquo;s own first or strongest impression
was or would be at sight of the thing pictured.
The effective order is usually that which would
be the actual experience of the reader if he were
standing in the flesh at the point of view indicated
by the author. This is the natural method, and
while it has its dangers, it is at once practical and
logical. In any case, there must be some reason
for the order, so that the reader may be led from
one point to the next. Consecutiveness is the logic
of Description and Narration.</p>

<p>As an example of describing where the details
are arranged as they would be likely to catch the
attention of the spectator, we may take this picture
from that classic of American literature, Sylvester
Judd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Margaret:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The pond covered several hundreds of acres, its
greatest diameter measuring about a mile and a half;
its outline was irregular, here divided by sharp rocks,
there retreating into shaded coves; and on its face appeared
three or four small islands, bearing trees and
low bushes. Its banks, if not really steep, had a bluff
and precipitous aspect from the tall forest that girdled
it about.&mdash;Ch. i.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Or this exquisite bit from Stevenson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The river there is dammed back for the service of
the flour-mill just below, so that it lies deep and darkling,
and the sand slopes into brown obscurity with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
glint of gold; and it has but newly been recruited by
the borrowings of the snuff-mill just above, and these,
tumbling merrily in, shake the pool to its black heart,
fill it with drowsy eddies, and set the curded froth of
many other mills solemnly steering to and fro upon
the surface.&mdash;<i>The Manse.</i></p></div>

<p>Dickens observes this natural order in many of
his detailed pictures of persons. The portrait of
Mr. Grimwig may serve as an example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>At this moment there walked into the room, supporting
himself by a thick stick, a stout old gentleman,
rather lame in one leg, who was dressed in a
blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and gaiters,
and a broad-brimmed white hat with the sides
turned up with green. A very small-plaited shirt-frill
stuck out from his waistcoat, and a very long
steel watch-chain, with nothing but a key at the end,
dangled loosely below it. The ends of his white neckerchief
were twisted into a ball about the size of an
orange; the variety of shapes into which his countenance
was twisted defy description. He had a manner
of screwing his head round on one side when he
spoke, and looking out of the corners of his eyes at the
same time, which irresistibly reminded the beholder of
a parrot.&mdash;<i>Oliver Twist.</i></p></div>

<p class="noindent">This elaboration of particulars is somewhat out of
fashion. Particulars are grasped by the eye so quickly that the
deliberation of words is apt to destroy proportion, while it is also
true that the reader is in danger of forgetting the beginning before
he reaches the end.</p>

<p>It is perhaps worth while to give an example of
the abuse of this method, since all inexperienced
writers have a tendency to mistake a catalogue for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
a description. It is manifestly idle to pile up particulars,
unless they are kept subordinate to some
central thought. Here is the description of the
heroine of a modern English novel, &ldquo;A Chelsea
Householder:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To begin, then, Muriel was tall, with a slight, erect
figure, a quick step, and an air of youth and vigor
which did the beholder good to look at.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Her face was oval, as nearly oval at least as a face can be in
which the chin is a good deal more pronounced than
is usual in classic beauties. The cheeks were pale,
paler than they had any business to be, judging by
the rest of the physique, the most noticeable fact in
point of coloring being that the eyes, hair, brows, and
lashes were all of the same, or pretty nearly the same,
color&mdash;a deep, dark brown, inclining to chestnut
above the temples, from which the hair was brushed
courageously back, so as to form a small knot at the
back of the head. Her eyes&mdash;not, perhaps, by the
way, a strikingly original trait in a heroine&mdash;were
large and bright; indeed, brighter or pleasanter eyes
have seldom looked out of a woman&rsquo;s face, their
beauty consisting less in their size and color than in
this very vividness and brightness, which seemed to
shine out of the irises themselves. For all that, the
face in repose was not exactly a bright one, or rather
the brightness came to it only by fits and starts, its
prevailing expression being a somewhat sober one, a
sobriety giving way, however, at a touch, and being
replaced by a peculiarly sunshiny smile and glance.</p></div>

<p>This is not the whole of the paragraph, but it
is enough for our purpose. There need not be a
better example of how not to do it, or of how much
may be said about a thing without conveying any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
definite idea of it. For my own part, I have no
idea whatever how Muriel looked, and long before
I got half through her verbal portrait I had ceased
to care. Few faults are more common than this
furnishing a list of particulars in the expectation
that the reader will construct therefrom the picture
which the author has not been clever enough
to make clear&mdash;a method, it might be added, not
unlike the system of punctuation adopted by the
late so-called Lord Timothy Dexter, who put all
the points together at the end of his book, and
directed his readers to distribute them at their
own pleasure.</p>

<p>It is hardly needful to remark upon the prime
necessity of clearness in description, but it is perhaps
not amiss to remind beginners that it is not
possible to picture a thing which the writer does
not himself see. If he is writing of an imaginary
landscape and speak of a tree, he should be able
if he choose to count the branches of that tree as
clearly as if it in reality stood before him. Unless
he know whether the heads of the flowers tip to
the right or to the left, whether the sheep on the
hillside of which he writes are nearer the fence
on the one side or to the stone wall on the other,
unless he can with inner vision actually see the
shape of the heroine&rsquo;s head and the length of her
fingers, the slope of her neck and the folds of her
gown as if she were in bodily presence before him,
he cannot describe any of these things. He cannot
tell what he does not know. More than that,
he cannot tell to others as much as he knows; so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
that unless he be able to see a good deal more
than he wishes to impart, he will fail to convey as
much as he desires.</p>

<p>It is of importance to cultivate the habit of
visualizing things, if one intends to describe them.
The mind should be trained to conceive of them as
visibly before it. This is the only way of arriving
at the power of vivid portrayal. It is easy to go
through the books of great writers and select those
which show that the authors have this power of
visualization. If a writer has it not, no skill of
diction or of construction can avail to supply its
lack.</p>

<p>In Description we have again occasion to emphasize
the rule which was given in Exposition:
proceed from the near to the remote; from the
physical to the mental; from the obvious to the
obscure. Homer, surpassed in happiness of epithet
by Shakespeare only, affords abundant illustrations
of this point. He says, for instance: &ldquo;Wheels
round, brazen, eight-spoked;&rdquo; &ldquo;shields smooth,
beautiful, brazen, well-hammered.&rdquo; The particulars
are given in the order in which they would
naturally be observed. That the wheel is round
and that the shield is smooth, the eye perceives at
once. The second glance adds the fact of material,
and so on.</p>

<p>What is meant by taking up the physical before
the mental is illustrated by the following sentence
from a theme picturing the appearance of a harbor
in the West Indies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In the distance I saw six or seven vessels in quarantine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
for yellow fever, all flying yellow flags.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">The process of the mind is here reversed. The
spectator sees the flags and reflects that they indicate quarantine
for yellow fever. It is not, as a general thing, well to intersperse
these mental comments. It may properly be done in a case like this,
because in reading, as in seeing, the mind is likely to inquire what
is the signification of the yellow flags; and it is well to answer
this question in order that the reader&rsquo;s attention do not wander
in search of an answer. If this is to be done, however, the physical
appearance which gives rise to the interrogation should be given
first. To reverse the order is something like giving first an answer
and then the conundrum to which it belongs.</p>

<p>It is as bad as mixing metaphors to mingle physical
and mental characteristics. In a description of
the volcano of Kilauea I found this sentence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The combination of vivid red and green contrasted
with the deathlike quiet and grandeur of the crater.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">It is not possible to contrast physical qualities
like color with emotional ones such as quiet and grandeur. It is like
multiplying pictures by potatoes.</p>

<p>Of effects used in Description the appeal to the
sight is manifestly by far the most effective. Indeed,
it is to be questioned whether any other is
of use save in very rare instances. Of course the
individual temperament of the reader has much
to do with this matter, and I am perhaps influenced
by the fact that while it is very easy for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
me to see things in imagination it is rather difficult
for me to hear them. There is no question,
however, that an appeal to the sense of hearing is
with the average reader less likely to be convincing
than that to sight. It seems to me also that the
use of smell is less often successful than either of
the others, and yet Kipling has shown how effective
this may be if employed by a master. The mention
of odors is more likely, perhaps, to belong to
description by suggestion than to description simple
and direct.</p>

<p>An important element in Description is movement.
This consists in showing the details of
a picture as if the mind of the reader were moving
from one to another. It is secured by naming
them as they would be observed; by presenting
them as they would successively become apparent
to some other person; or by exhibiting them in
connection with their effects. Perhaps I may be
able to show this by three brief pictures of a
peasant girl.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. She was a beautiful peasant girl, tall and slender,
dressed in the fashion of the country, and carrying
in her hand a bunch of scarlet poppies. Her snowy
coif was pushed back, showing brown cheeks, a mass of
black hair, and bright, startled eyes.</p>

<p>2. Paul watched the tall, slender peasant come up
the flowery lane, twirling in her hand as she walked a
handful of flaming red poppies. He was sure that she
had not noticed him, and he smiled at the unconscious
beauty of her brown face, clear eyes, and black, wavy
hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The artist&rsquo;s gaze was suddenly arrested by a
tall peasant girl, who walked slowly up the lane. He
stopped to watch her, attracted by the grace of her slender
figure, and noting appreciatively the effect against
her gray gown of the scarlet poppies which she was
twirling in her brown hands. As she drew nearer, and
unconsciously pushed back the snowy coif, an involuntary
exclamation escaped his lips at the brilliancy of
the eyes which flashed out at him from beneath her
black, tumbled hair.</p></div>

<p>Such movement as there is in the first of these
depends upon the arrangement of the particulars
in the order in which they would naturally be
perceived by the reader; in the second this order
is shown to be natural by presentation of the details
as if they were seen by a spectator; while
in the third the effect is heightened by the introduction
of the emotions aroused in the mind of
the artist by the sight of the girl. Whether these
examples make the fact clear or not, there is no
question that the last form is the most effective.
It is not always available, nor is it always appropriate;
but when it is possible it is more vivid
and persuasive than any other method. There is
in it more suggestiveness, and hence there is more
force.</p>

<p>As a practical example of the use of this method,
this from Thomas Hardy may serve:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>How very lovable her face was to him! There
was nothing ethereal about it; all was real vitality,
real warmth, real incarnation. Yet when all was
thought and felt that could be thought and felt about
her features in general, it was her mouth which turned
out to be the magnetic pole thereof. Eyes almost as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
deep and speaking he had seen before, and cheeks
perhaps as fair; brows as arched, a chin and throat
almost as shapely; her mouth he had seen nothing at
all to equal on the face of the earth. To a young
man with the least fire in him, that little upward lift
in the middle of her top lip was distracting, infatuating,
maddening. He had never before seen a woman&rsquo;s
lips and teeth which forced upon his mind, with such
persistent iteration, the old Elizabethan simile of roses
filled with snow.&mdash;<i>Tess of the D&rsquo;Urbervilles</i>, xxiv.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> A pleasant if a little exaggerated illustration of the way in
which pictures are made up from materials in the mind is afforded
by this account of the vision of Rome which a boy conjured
up in his mind: &ldquo;Rome! &hellip; I tried to imagine what it
would be like when I got there. The Coliseum I knew, of course,
from a woodcut in the history-book; so to begin with I plumped
that down in the middle. The rest had to be patched up from the
little gray market-town where twice a year we went to have our hair
cut; hence, in the result, Vespasian&rsquo;s amphitheatre was approached
by muddy little streets, wherein the Red Lion and the Blue Boar,
with Somebody&rsquo;s Entire along their front, and &ldquo;Commercial
Room&rdquo; on their windows; the doctor&rsquo;s house, of substantial red
brick; and the façade of the New Wesleyan Chapel, which we
thought very fine, were the chief architectural ornaments; while
the Roman populace pottered about in smocks and corduroys,
twisting the tails of the Roman calves and inviting each other to
beer in musical Wessex.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Kenneth Graham</span>: <i>The Golden Age</i>.</p>

<p class="captitle">DESCRIPTION CONTINUED</p>

<p>Description by Suggestion is perhaps not to be
called Description in the exact meaning of the
word, but in so far as it is an attempt to call up an
image it is proper to consider it so. Even if it
seem but an attempt to induce in the mind the
spirit of a scene, a character, or a thing, it may still
be treated as Description, since the main purpose
is to bring vividly to the thought of the reader the
image of the thing spoken of.</p>

<p>It has already been said that words can add no
material image to those in the mind, but must
work by the rearrangement of what is already
there. If I read the account of a little rustic pond
I call to mind some sheet of water that I have seen.
If I have lived in the South the picture is likely to
be that of a lakelet bordered by moss-hung trees,
while if my experiences have been confined to New
England I shall involuntarily think of northern
foliage and scenery. I shall in any case construct
out of old images this new one. Now the mind is
best able to do this for itself if simply properly
aroused and guided instead of being too minutely
directed. In direct description the author adds
particular to particular, bidding the reader put one
detail in place by the others. If a writer do this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
with sufficient skill, he may succeed in inducing
the consciousness of the reader to follow him; but
always he is leading and the other is being led.
On the other hand, when a suggestion is used the
reader is aroused to take, as it were, the initiative.
When Dickens calls Mrs. Fezziwig &ldquo;one vast, substantial
smile,&rdquo; he stimulates the reader to picture
the woman for himself. Here the imagination of
the one who reads takes the lead instead of following.
It goes by the path pointed out by the author,
but it goes by itself. The result is that freshness
and clearness of impression which belong only to
what the mind does or seems to do voluntarily.</p>

<p>This is perhaps making more of a show of psychology
than the occasion calls for or than my
knowledge of that difficult science warrants; but
at least it may serve to emphasize once more the
fact that whatever the writer can induce the reader
to do for himself is sure to be greatly more effective
than anything which the writer can do for him.
Herein lies the value of suggestive description. It
arouses the mind to be actively receptive. Another
way of putting the same thing would perhaps be to
say that avowed description appeals more to the
understanding, while suggestion addresses itself
more directly to the imagination.</p>

<p>The simplest form of any description is of course
the epithet. This in literal description is apt to
be ineffective from its meagreness. In suggestion
it is often rich and satisfactory. When Homer
speaks of the &ldquo;swift-footed Achilles,&rdquo; he has not
pictured the hero, yet he conveys by the implication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
of the epithet an image which is not without
distinctness. The same is true of such Homeric
phrases as &ldquo;far-darting Apollo,&rdquo; &ldquo;laughter-loving
Aphrodite,&rdquo; or &ldquo;ox-eyed Juno.&rdquo; In the same way
into a single simile may be condensed a description
by suggestion which could be given directly only
by pages. To go to the &ldquo;Iliad,&rdquo; again, take this
example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As the gusts speed on, when shrill winds blow, on
a day when dust lies thickest on the roads, and the
winds raise together a great cloud of dust, even so their
battle clashed together, and all were fain of heart to
slay each other in the press with the keen bronze.&mdash;Lang&rsquo;s
<i>Iliad</i>, xiii.</p></div>

<p>There is here no direct picture, yet the mind
sees the confused and furious onslaught more
clearly than if all its details were enumerated.</p>

<p>Lowell notes a happy instance of this sort of
picturing by intimation when he says of Chaucer:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Sometimes he describes amply by the merest hint,
as where the Friar, before setting himself down, drives
away the cat. We know without need of more words
that he has chosen the snuggest corner.</p></div>

<p>Another remark which Lowell makes in this connection
I cannot pass without quoting:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When Chaucer describes anything, it is commonly
in one of those simple and obvious epithets or qualities
that are so easy to miss. Is it a woman? He tells
us that she is <i>fresh</i>; that she has <i>glad</i> eyes; that
&ldquo;every day her beauty newed.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">Notice the phrase, &ldquo;those simple and obvious epithets
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
or qualities that are so easy to miss.&rdquo; Whatever
we may learn later, we all begin by supposing
that it is imperative for a writer to go far
afield, and to discover traits, epithets, and thoughts
that nobody has used before. Here as in all writing
he succeeds best who most carefully confines
himself to just those traits, epithets, and thoughts
which people have used before, but who so uses
them that they have new force. He must feel
so keenly whatever he writes that his words shall
seem new because of the conviction behind them;
and the reader will find a continual charm in this
discovery, as it were, of the meaning of familiar
terms.</p>

<p>In common practice it is seldom that either of
the two sorts of composition which I have named is
used alone, and the most successful method is that
which happily unites them. No literature can go
far or effect much which does not call suggestion
to its aid, and this is perhaps more emphatically
true in Description than in any other division of
composition. Description is really a kind of continued
comparison of the image which is in the
mind of the writer with things which the reader
may be supposed to have seen. As in the use of
comparison in simile, suggestion is the most effective
tool at the hand of the craftsman. It might
be added that the rules given for the use of figures
will be found, by one who takes the trouble to
examine them, to be practically and directly applicable
to Description.</p>

<p>I have spoken carefully thus far as if Description
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
had to do with nothing save the picturing of the
physical. There was perhaps danger lest the word
&ldquo;picture&rdquo; might seem forced if too soon applied
to things mental and intangible. Description, however,
has as one of its common and legitimate functions,
perhaps as its highest office, the picturing
of conditions of mind, of states of emotion, of all
sorts of mental experiences. Its office is to call
them up so vividly that the reader shall realize
and share them. Not that he shall feel them as
his own, but as if he saw them with the most intimate
and sympathetic comprehension of them. If
the reader received the sorrow of King Lear as his
own, he would be in danger of going mad as King
Lear went mad. If he shared as a personal experience
the love of Romeo for Juliet, no other maid
of actual flesh and blood would satisfy his devotion.
It is not as a personal but as an imaginative
experience that one is to enter into these passions.
The description of an emotion is an endeavor to
give a picture of it in much the same sense that a
picture of a landscape is given. The reader does
not in either case mistake the mental impression
for the actual thing, but in both instances he is
moved by the completeness and reality of the portrayal.</p>

<p>We come here very close to Narration, and to
what has been said of the description of physical
things there is not much which need be added to
cover the case of immaterial things. The principles
are much the same in one effort as in the other.
In the bringing up of emotions and states of feeling
it is more often wise to use the suggestive
method. The question is moreover one of greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
subtilty and delicacy. In the one case as in the
other it is generally well to be governed by the
order in which the details of the reality would present
themselves to the inner sense. The natural
is apt to be the most effective order. It is well,
too, to go from the near to the remote, from the
likely to the unlikely, from the simple to the
complex.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not amiss to make here an especial
point of the phrase which has been used two or
three times already in other connections: Proceed
generally from the physical to the mental. If
without too evident artifice the physical can be
made the introduction to the mental state, the impression
is almost sure to be vivid. The picturing
of sensations is at once the most surely effective
and the most richly suggestive. Rudyard Kipling
is a master of this. He constantly leads the mind
of the reader to emotions through description of a
physical sensation; and it is largely by his skill
in this that he overcomes the difficulty of dealing
with themes and emotions which are so far from
the ordinary experience of an occidental audience.
Stevenson is another author who understood well
the use of the physical. His wonderful description
of the flight through the heather in &ldquo;Kidnapped&rdquo;
is one of the most brilliant examples of this sort of
writing in modern&mdash;indeed, why should one not
say in all?&mdash;literature.</p>

<p>In summing up, it seems to me just to say that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
he who would paint with words must have not only
the power of writing well, but he must also possess
three especial qualities. He must be able to
perceive a general effect; he must be able to analyze
this general effect into the details which produce
it; and he must have the ability so to express
these particulars that their relative values shall
be preserved. The reader must first be given a
broad idea of the thing, the scene, the person to
be pictured. This is no less true in a case where
the object is to fix the attention upon details than
where the aim is to give a broad impression. The
mind does not, I believe, grasp the details until
after it has received the wider impression, and it is
necessary to make the latter the background of the
former. A remark which is made by Fuseli upon
painting may be applied here. He observes that
breadth is attained not by the <i class="cor1">o</i>mission of details,
but by their <i class="cor1">sub</i>mission. While it is idle to catalogue,
it is not needful to omit anything which is
of use in conveying the picture sought. As long
as the details are made to submit to the central
thought, are kept clear and subordinate, there is no
call to suppress them.</p>

<p>Above everything must the writer of Description
see clearly what he wishes to picture, feel genuinely
what he desires to communicate, and confine himself
to that which is seen and felt by him,&mdash;by
him alone out of all the persons who walk this
earth. If it is with vague sensations that he is
dealing, they must yet be clear and real to him; if
it is with the emotions of imaginary persons, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
with their emotions as these are felt by him. This
is the most difficult task in literary art; it is, too,
when properly accomplished, the most splendid
triumph of literary skill.</p>

<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI">XVI</a></h2>

<p class="captitle">NARRATION</p>

<p>The more fascinating any literary work, the
more difficult it is to write about it satisfactorily.
The mention of the D&rsquo;Artagnan Romances brings
up so vivid a suggestion of life and stir, of adventure
and fire, that any essay which discourses of
these superb novels is almost sure to seem tame
by contrast. In the mere names of &ldquo;Tom Jones,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Henry Esmond,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Scarlet Letter,&rdquo; there is
so much potency that simply to use them as illustrations
involves the danger of rendering dull and
opaque by contrast the surface of exposition in
which they are set like jewels. Even the specification
of Narration as a division of composition
connotes so many pleasant sensations that he must
be a clever man who can deal with the technicalities
of this sort of writing without boring his readers.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered, however, that before
&ldquo;The Lesson in Anatomy&rdquo; could be painted Rembrandt
had to learn how canvas is prepared and
how colors are mixed; that the Ninth Symphony
could not be composed until dry details of counterpoint
and harmony had been mastered. It is apt
to seem to the inexperienced writer as if to study
the technique of art is to brush the bloom from the
peach. He likes to feel that only what is spontaneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
can be fresh and vital; and he forgets that
in art spontaneity is impossible until the technical
method has been so perfectly mastered that the
creative impulse is unhampered by inability to express
itself. It is not the untrained and the inexperienced
who are able to be naïve and fresh in art,
but only the master to whom technical excellence
has become a second nature.</p>

<p>Having in a former talk declared Description
to be the most difficult sort of composition, I am
tempted now to make a bull, and to declare that
Narration is more difficult still! Indeed, this
would hardly be extravagant, were it not that the
natural, instinctive interest of mankind in whatever
is a story comes to the aid of him who writes
a narrative. Narration as it exists in practice,
however, is hardly to be considered alone. Of
all varieties of composition, this is the one which
most comprehensively embraces all other forms.
It demands all the resources of the literary artist.
Exposition, Argument, and Description are all enlisted
in the services of the story-teller; and are
so blended in the woof of his web that they can
scarcely be disassociated from the narrative itself.</p>

<p>A succession of events can be fully told only in
words. Even when we see a clever pantomime&mdash;as,
for example, &ldquo;L&rsquo;Enfant Prodigue,&rdquo; which
was extensively played in this country by a French
company a year or two ago,&mdash;we are forced to
supply in our minds a sort of running interpretation
of the acts as they go on before us. Music
may interpret continuous emotions, but its inadequacy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
to tell a definite tale is abundantly shown
by that odd hybrid known as &ldquo;programme music.&rdquo;
Painting may give a succession of related themes,
but between the moments chosen for representation
there are gaps which break the continuity. To
convey a complete and continuous account of events
there is no resource in all the arts but words. It
naturally follows that Narration is more intimately
connected with actual life than any other sort of
writing. It is the events of life which move us,
and the history of these arouses the feelings as no
expository or argumentative page can arouse them.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to enumerate all the many
forms which Narration takes. Histories, biographies,
plays, novels, romances, anecdotes, epics,
stories long and stories short, the account of a
journey and the folk-tale through which the fairies
frisk fantastically, are all included under this
division. The tedious twaddle and sea-water of
&ldquo;The Voyage of the Sunbeam,&rdquo; and the quivering
pages of &ldquo;Les Misérables,&rdquo; the account of a fire
or a burglary in the morning paper, the anecdote
over which a pair of drummers chuckle in a Western
railway car, and the delicate romances of Hawthorne,&mdash;beautiful
and pure as delicate frost-work
seen by moonlight,&mdash;all these belong here, and all
these are but a part. It is manifestly impossible
to take up each variety separately, even were it at
all worth while. We must be content to concern
ourselves with general principles. Fortunately it
is not difficult so to phrase these that they shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
applicable to narratives of all sorts. So many so-called
stories written by inexperienced writers are
merely memoranda for tales, undigested and unarranged,
that there is sufficient excuse for being
somewhat rudimentary in our treatment of the subject.
While young authors continue to give us the
material for narratives instead of properly formed
and finished Narration there is at least the chance
of doing good.</p>

<p>The first requisite in setting out to tell a story
is to have a story to tell. It is true that not a few
modern novels might be cited as seeming to prove
the opposite of this proposition. There is a recent
school of fiction in which the first principle seems
to be that if one is to attempt to tell a story he
must above all things else be careful not to have
one in his remotest thought. The patron saint of
such writers seems to be the needy knife-grinder of
Canning, with his</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;Story! God bless you! I have none to tell, sir.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="noindent">The world in general, however, still holds logically
to the old theory, and believes that to have something
to relate is essential in Narration.</p>

<p>It is not that the theme of a narrative need be
elaborate. There are many successful novels and
stories with plots extremely simple. Not one of
Miss Wilkins&rsquo; New England idyls&mdash;those charming
sublimations of the homely&mdash;has complexity
or intricacy of subject. The only point is that
the writer have in mind some definite and consecutive
narrative, with a beginning and an end, and
that he tell it as a narrative, and not as an Exposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
or an Argument. The whole matter is well
summed up in the phrase of Anthony Trollope:
&ldquo;The writer, when he sits down to commence his
novel, should do so, not because he has to tell a
story, but because he has a story to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It would hardly do at this late day to insist,
however, that the object of a story shall be simply
or even primarily the narration of incident. It has
been greatly the fashion during the last score of
years to subordinate incident to any one of several
things. Many of the greatest novelists of the present
half-century have deliberately subordinated
events to the study of character. There are not
a few modern novels which can be adequately described
only as emotional dissecting-rooms. They
display the most wonderful cleverness in dismembering
emotions,&mdash;too often without having a living
figure or a convincing incident from one cover
to the other. It is but fair to add that there are
also fictions which seem to justify this method,
whether we like it or not.</p>

<p>For our sins, moreover, the malevolent deities
that deal in literary plagues have sent upon us that
mongrel monstrosity, the novel with a theory. The
more harmless are in the form of simpering eccentricities,
or in the shape of childishly naïve whimsicalities;
in the more hurtful sort authors often
highly gifted lavish their powers in support of theories
as generous in intention as they are mistaken
and sentimental when tried by the facts upon which
they are founded. We have, too, the theological
novel, and the indecent novel, and more sorts than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
it is at all worth while to mention, in all of which
the telling of a story is made the excuse for the
exploiting of some view. Of these, however, we
shall have occasion to speak later in connection
with the moral purpose in fiction.</p>

<p>It has been remarked by Stevenson that in stories
in which incident is made subordinate to character-drawing
the interest is sure to be less vivid.
He remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>In character-studies the pleasure we take is critical;
we watch, we approve, we smile at incongruities,
we are moved to sudden heats of sympathy with courage,
suffering, or virtue. But the characters are still
themselves, they are not us; the more clearly they are
depicted, the more widely do they stand away from us,
the more imperiously do they thrust us back into our
place as a spectator&hellip;. It is not character but incident
that woos us out of our reserve. Something
happens as we desire it to happen to ourselves; some
situation, that we have long dallied with in fancy, is
realized in the story with enticing and appropriate details.
Then we forget the characters; then we push
the hero aside; then we plunge into the tale in our
own person and bathe in fresh experience; and then,
and then only, do we say that we have been reading a
romance.&mdash;<i>A Gossip on Romance.</i></p></div>

<p>All these considerations are of interest to the
student, and they should all be taken into account
when he is looking for a subject or when he is
considering methods. As a matter of practical
work, it is probably true that nobody goes to work
to construct stories without having some theme,
some dominating suggestion in mind. He will
therefore form his plot or shape his subject according
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
to this germinating thought, without for the
moment taking theories much into account. Have
a theme he must, and to my thinking the more objective
this is the better. The more it deals with
outward things and shows what is within through
them; the more it has of incident and is concerned
with the actualities of life; the more it has of
broad realities as distinguished from the trivialities
of existence, the more likely it is to succeed.</p>

<p>In the treatment of a theme, the first thing is to
be sure that it is thoroughly known to the writer.
I do not mean that it is necessary to know every
detail. I do mean that what is known should be
apprehended clearly; that there should be no doubt
about the end and the beginning, whatever vagueness
there may be about the minutiæ of the way
from one to the other. It is especially important
in story-writing that the author know his characters
before he write about them. It is generally safe
to compose half a dozen chapters before beginning
a novel, chapters which are not to be used in the
book at all, but which serve to make the author
acquainted with the personages he is to deal with.
If every young novelist would study the methods
of Hawthorne in this respect it would be to his advantage.
Any one who is at all accustomed to
examining literature critically knows how almost
universal it is that new authors show in the first
third or quarter of their books that they are slowly
becoming aware of the natures of the characters
in their fiction. Often the middle of the work is
reached before the writer has any clear or intimate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
knowledge of the men and women whom he is trying
to picture.</p>

<p>I do not believe in hard and fast rules for the
construction of stories. Methods of work must
vary with individual temperaments. My own way
of work naturally seems to me the most logical,
but I realize that this is a question which each writer
must decide for himself. Personally, I find it necessary
to know the general course of a story, and
above all to know the end, before I can begin it.
Once these are clear and true in my mind, I deliberately
consider the beginning. I say &ldquo;deliberately
consider&rdquo; because the succeeding steps have
so much the air of being involuntary. Once I have
decided where to begin, I devote myself to the
study of my characters. I walk the streets with
them; they have a share in my waking and in my
sleep. I know the general course of the history
I am trying to tell, but the details I am content
to learn slowly. The thing which I endeavor to do
is to be sure of the character of those who are involved
in this history. I am not without a feeling
that an old fellow who sits in solitary state
in the attic of my brain tells me the incidents of
the narrative, but the acquaintance of the actors I
must make for myself.</p>

<p>Not only must a story be known to the writer
but it must for the time being at least be true to
him. He must believe it as he writes; he must be
completely possessed by a sense of the verity of
what he is telling, or he cannot persuade the reader
to accept it as real. It may seem to you that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
is equivalent to saying that a novelist must be a
good deal like the White Queen in &ldquo;Through a
Looking Glass,&rdquo; who practiced until she was able
to believe as many as six impossible things before
breakfast. The difference is that the novelist does
not have to practice. The characters become so
vital in his mind, they act so independently and
with so evident a will of their own, that it is impossible
not to feel that their story is actual. Of
course I do not mean that if the novelist were put
on oath he would affirm that the tale is true; yet
it seems to me that if I were called upon to swear
that a story which I had written were not true, I
should go about forever after with a humiliated
sense that I had committed perjury.</p>

<p>I think it is the experience of every novelist that
characters in a tale will often act apparently at their
own good pleasure and in open defiance of the intention
of the writer. They are not infrequently
almost as independent of the will of the author of
their being as the modern child is said to be independent
of the will of the author of his. I have
myself struggled to force characters to do a certain
thing and have written and rewritten certain chapters
in my effort to make them follow my wishes.
I could set down the words which declared that they
had done the thing which I desired, but I knew that
I was lying and I was conscious that my characters
knew that I knew it, so that of course there was
nothing to do but to tear up the falsehood and tell
the truth. The explanation of all this is, I suppose,
that the superficial conclusions of the mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
are corrected by the unconscious logic of the imagination.
The characters of the personages in
the story being what they are, the personages must
inevitably behave in a certain way, and an underlying
perception of this fundamental truth prevents
an imaginative author from being able to treat his
fictitious people as puppets.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>The importance of knowing the end from the
beginning is the same whether one is telling an
anecdote or is writing a history, a romance, or a
biography. It is necessary to discriminate clearly
in regard to the climax of an anecdote, as it is to
be sure of the climax of a novel. Everybody knows
how the story which in the mouth of one man is
racy and pointed becomes stupid and ineffective
the moment it is told by another. I have to thank
an English gentleman for having unconsciously
furnished me with an example of the disadvantage
of relating an anecdote with the wrong end first.
He told in the smoking-room of a London hotel an
incident which I dimly remembered as being in
James Dodds&rsquo; &ldquo;Biographical Study of Chalmers,&rdquo;
and I made a note of his version in order to compare
the two. This is Dodds&rsquo; story:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>[Chalmers] was present at an evening party where
a very accomplished lady was discoursing most eloquent
music from the fashionable opera of the day. When
she was at the overture and the recitatives he looked
perplexed, as if listening to a medley of madness; but
when she struck upon some lively and expressive airs,
he turned with a look of great relief to the gentleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
who was next to him: &ldquo;Do you know, sir, I love
these lucid intervals!&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>This is the way in which the English gentleman
told it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;I say, don&rsquo;t you know, Dr. Chalmers called tunes
lucid intervals. Wasn&rsquo;t that deuced good? Lucid
intervals, by Jove! He heard a lady sing, don&rsquo;t you
know, and that&rsquo;s what he said. He didn&rsquo;t mean all
tunes of course; but she&rsquo;d been playing things, you
know, and putting in instrumental fal-lals and crazy
things on the keys, and finally came to a song. I call
that devilish witty, don&rsquo;t you know!&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It is hardly necessary to give examples of this
fault, and this seems absurd and extravagant. It
came so providentially, however, at the very time
when I was writing these lectures, that it was not
to be resisted.</p>

<p>It is excellent practice for the student to write
out stories or incidents which come under his observation,
and good things which he hears said or
told. There are few exercises in which it is more
easily possible to interest an ordinary class in composition
than work of this sort, and it may be
made of a good deal of value. To be really of use
it is necessary that the story be told and retold
until it is in the best possible form that the student
can compass. It should be done as carefully
as if it were a great and complete narrative.</p>

<p>I said in another talk that I am not willing to
concede that conversation is an art which comes by
nature, and the justice of this must be especially
felt by one who listens when story-telling is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
order of the day. Those who succeed in telling a
story well are those who have taken the trouble to
learn how. It is a mistake to suppose that the
carelessly spoken anecdote which is so felicitously
put that it seems to be the thought of the moment
has cost the narrator nothing. He has consciously
labored to attain the art of telling things well; and
while here as everywhere natural gifts count, the
man who cultivates a small talent can generally
outshine him who leaves a great talent to take care
of itself.</p>

<p>I have perhaps spoken so as to give the impression
that a story makes itself. I mean nothing of
the sort. It is true that the first germ of a fiction
is often caught in the mind as a plumy-winged seed
of the wild clematis is caught in the cranny of a
wall. Sometimes a chance word, the sight of a face
in the crowd, a bit of information or talk, will become
the suggestion from which a story will grow.
It must be nurtured, however, if its growth is to
be vigorous or symmetrical. It must be brooded
over and watched; it must be nourished and tended.
When a story is well formed in the mind and the
characters are well defined, it will grow and develop
spontaneously, but it must be given a good
start first. In other words, the theme must be
dwelt upon until it is so completely a part of the
thought that the mind will carry it forward unconsciously,
and the tale will seem to be going on of
itself.</p>

<p>It is customary to say that all narrative has four
elements: first, what happened,&mdash;the plot or story;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
second, what persons were concerned,&mdash;the characters;
third, the situation, which is both in time
and space,&mdash;in other words the when and the
where; fourth, the central motive,&mdash;the thing of
interest or significance for which the whole is told.
These elements seem to me to be likely to come to
the writer in the order in which I have named them.
Sometimes he is aware of the central purpose first,
especially in fiction written with a declared motive;
but this does not appear to be the natural order in
the case of fiction really imaginative. An author
must of course have a comprehension of the central
motive before he begins to write, but he deduces it
from his plot rather than forms a plot to embody
the idea. All this analysis is of more value in revision
of work or in criticism than in actual composition.
The writer who is really alive and interested
in what he is doing thinks of his story as a
story and as a transcript from life, not as a combination
of four elements.</p>

<p>In this same line of criticism and revision it is
well to note that Narration is necessarily specific,
progressive, and cumulative. It is specific in that it
deals with facts rather than with theories, with incidents
rather than with deductions, with events rather
than with reflections. It is progressive in that the
interest must move forward, and the theme must
advance with the incidents. A collection of incidents
does not make a narrative any more than
a pile of lumber makes a house. There must be a
sequence of events related to each other by the tie
of cause and effect. Narration is cumulative because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
this chain of cause and effect must lead to
some conclusion, some climax, some end. Even in
the relation of the most trifling anecdotes these
three qualities are to be found, and in their perfection
lies the secret of the greatest works of literature.
The theorists who excuse inartistic and
unsymmetrical fiction by the theory that a novel
should be a piece cut out of life and having neither
beginning or end, forget that that which is comely
and fit, so long as it is part of the living tree-trunk,
becomes an unsightly block when it is chopped out.
It must be shaped and finished to be again beautiful.
The story which has by relation been taken
from its place in actual life must be worked and
polished by art; it must become a whole in itself
or it is forever an uncomely log, crudely disfiguring
the landscape and fit only to be used as material
for work or to feed the fire.</p>

<h2><a name="XVII" id="XVII">XVII</a></h2>

<p class="captitle">NARRATION CONTINUED</p>

<p>The point of view is of no less importance in
Narration than in Description. It is perhaps not
so strictly observed, because to the ordinary writer
it is less obvious. As a rule it is not specifically
announced. If a tale is in the form of an autobiography,
as &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe,&rdquo; for instance, or
&ldquo;Henry Esmond,&rdquo; the point of view is of course
that of the perceptions of the character who relates.
To this the author must confine himself,
and every time that he introduces incidents, words,
or thoughts which this character could not have
known he violates it. He breaks the continuity
and interrupts the impression of the reader. Less
obviously, many novelists practically hold to the
personality of one or two of their characters for
their point of view. Without any specification of
the fact, they refrain from telling anything which
might not have been known or felt by these personages.
An admirable illustration of this method
is &ldquo;The Scarlet Letter.&rdquo; Throughout the entire
book there are practically only three individualities
through whose perceptions the reader is called upon
to look. The author does not claim at any point
to be confining himself to these or to any one of
these; yet the comments and reflections which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
outside the observation of Hester Prynne, Arthur
Dimmesdale, and Roger Chillingworth are so close
to them as almost to seem part of their thought.
What is not actually within their perception is
little more than the author&rsquo;s expression of their
unformulated emotions or interpretations of their
motives. More than two thirds of the book is given
from the standpoint of the inner life of the wearer
of the scarlet letter, and the greater portion of the
remainder is from that of the minister.</p>

<p>Of course the writer may, if he choose, take as
the point of view the position of all knowledge.
He may decide to speak as one who knows every
thought. The inexperienced writer is especially
likely to be fond of this method. He is apt to
dance about in a confused and confusing will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp
ubiquity. The early days of story-writing are
marked by a delightful sense of omnipotence and
omniscience which seldom outlives the completion
of the first novel. While this feeling lasts the
author holds it a sort of duty to allow his readers
to look in turn through the eyes of each of
his characters. It is as if he were proprietor of a
peep-show. He cannot bring himself to defraud
the reader by putting him off with anything less
than a glimpse through every peep-hole. Whatever
is the point of view chosen, it must, as in all
other sorts of composition, be held throughout.
The point of view of a single character is that
which gives most intensity to a tale. The character
chosen becomes the embodiment of the thoughts
and emotions of the reader for the time being, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
dominates all others. This is perhaps even more
emphatically true when this is done by implication.
The assumption of a single personality in the story
as that which shall dominate seems to come from
the absorbing interest of the author in this character,
and it almost surely not only makes this the
most significant figure in the tale, but imparts to
the story fervor and strenuousness.</p>

<p>It is perhaps well to add a word of warning. It
is not wise to expect too much from the reader in
the way of coming to a point of view remote from
his ordinary attitude of mind. The short stories
of Miss Wilkins tacitly ask the reader to assume
the mood of an observer who sees the pathetic and
yet humorous quality in homely life. They owe
their success in no small degree to the simplicity of
this point of view and the consistency with which
it is kept throughout. In &ldquo;Pembroke&rdquo; the same
author goes farther, and tacitly asks us to regard
the quarrels of obstinate and ill-tempered rustics
with the profound seriousness demanded by the
crushing blows of inexorable fate. It is asking too
much. We cannot look upon these rural contests
of obstinacy with the solemnity demanded by a
Greek tragedy. It is a far cry from the &ldquo;&OElig;dipus&rdquo;
or the &ldquo;Antigone&rdquo; to &ldquo;Pembroke;&rdquo; and Miss
Wilkins makes too great a demand upon the reader
when she seems to assume so profound a solemnity.
It seems to me that herein lies one secret of the
disappointment felt in reading &ldquo;Pembroke&rdquo; after
the delights of the author&rsquo;s short stories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>The selection of incidents is naturally a matter
of the greatest importance in the construction of
any narrative, whether historic or fictitious. It is
evident that it is impossible to tell the whole truth
about any person, whether it be a character real
in flesh and blood or one of the personages so much
more real in imagination. A novelist cannot set
down all the particulars of the life of those about
whom he writes, and in the case of any story it
must be only the significant incidents that will
attract the reader. The literary code which professes
to find all facts of life of equal value is on
the face of it absurd, and had the men who claim
to hold it lived up to their creed their novels would
never have got beyond manuscript. Choice is
necessary, and the great principle of choice is significance.</p>

<p>When we speak of significance, we of course mean
the relation of the incident to the central motive
of the narrative. The rule is that details are to be
introduced or omitted as they do or do not form
an essential part of the whole. If the writer have
not the art so to weave in his most interesting and
novel incident that it shall be an integral portion
of the web, he must omit it. The taste of our time
has very little patience with that excrescence which
used to be known as an episode. Whatever is told
should help forward the general plan of the work.
The space and the importance given to each portion
must manifestly be determined by its value
in the entire scheme. Proportion is in effect the
same here as in any other form of composition, a
matter which depends upon the intention of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
whole.</p>

<p>The young writer who is moved to delight a
waiting and to his fancy impatient world with a
new work of fiction has generally read a good many
stories, and is likely to have gained from them
some unconscious sense of proportion. This may
save him from utter failure, but he is likely to
stumble over two serious obstacles. In the first
place he is sure to have his favorite situations, and
is apt to linger over these in a fond belief that his
readers will be as charmed as he is with these portions
of his tale. In the second place, he is likely
to feel a certain security in using incidents which
are taken from real life.</p>

<p>Of the first of these it is sufficient to say that
such is the perversity of fate that it almost never
happens that the reader agrees with the writer&mdash;especially
with the untrained writer&mdash;in regard
to the most interesting portions of a book. Indeed,
it is not amiss for a writer to be a little suspicious
of the parts of his work which he regards with
most favor. It is of importance to cultivate a dispassionate
habit of mind, and always to judge the
value of portions with relation to the whole rather
than with reference to the author&rsquo;s likes or dislikes.</p>

<p>The second point is one which needs to be emphasized.
The moment a man begins to write, his
friends begin to offer true stories for use,&mdash;not
one out of a hundred being usable; and they invariably
commend these subjects by saying that
they are things which really happened. It is
impossible to make the general public understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
that the fact that a thing happened is rather more
likely to be against it as literary material than in
its favor. Facts are admirable from their suggestiveness.
No fiction is of value which is not founded
upon them. They are to be used, however, as
material which must be shaped and moulded before
it can be used. They are the rocks from the quarry
that must be dressed before they are fit building
material. The danger lies in accepting actuality
instead of literary propriety as the measure of
value. There is perhaps no rule more useful or
more necessary to young writers of fiction than to
beware of the truth. If in a first novel are found
scenes and incidents which are unreal and extravagant,
the chances are that these are the things
which have been confidently taken from real life,&mdash;and
which have become hopelessly unreal in the
transfer. In Narration as in Description the thing
sought is not the truth but the impression of truth.
The question is not whether what is told is true,
but whether it seem true. We all know extraordinary
incidents which are real yet which are too
improbable to be used in fiction. The reason is
obvious. It is necessary for fiction to be probable,
while truth is free from all restrictions. The novelist
is never allowed to take refuge behind the
fact that a thing is veracious. He may tell whatever
he has the art to make appear true, but the
criterion of his success is the semblance of verity
rather than verity itself. Aristotle formulated all
this long ago,&mdash;&ldquo;Prefer an impossibility which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
seems probable to a probability which seems impossible.&rdquo;
The philosophy of the matter is that
fiction is tried by truth to the laws which lie behind
fact, and that it is no less true in being false than
reality is in being true.</p>

<p>It is to be remembered, however, that probability
is largely a matter of consistency. There is
always an implied hypothesis, a certain set of conditions
tacitly agreed to, by which the truth, or
rather the apparent truth, of any narrative is to
be tried. If one is writing history, the hypothesis
calls for actual facts and things which really occurred;
if it is a novel which is in construction,
actuality is no longer demanded, but probability
according to the time and place is essential; an
author may go farther by writing avowed romance,
and may put events impossible and improbable into
the very midst of the life of to-day, if he will but
keep them consistent throughout. It is a question
of what the writer attempts to do. If he
choose frankly to cut loose from fact and write a
fairy story, the hypothesis gives his fancy range,
and here it is the strict truth which must be
shunned as a violation of the implied conditions.
In a number of folk tales we read passages like
this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Then the fox stretched out his tail, the king&rsquo;s son
seated himself upon it, and away they went over stock
and stone, so that the wind whistled through their
hair.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">It would be manifestly a violation of the rules of
fairy lore to say instead:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Then the fox stretched out his tail, and the king&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
son tried to seat himself upon it; but of course it
would not support him, so he rolled over in the mud.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">To thrust facts upon the reader here is to depart
from the standard. When we sit down to read
fairy tales we have tacitly consented to believe the
impossible, and upon this assumption fairy lore becomes,
in the happy phrase of Douglas Jerrold,
&ldquo;as true as sunbeams.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All this, however, is the exception, and as it is
an exception which is sufficiently obvious, it is
enough to mention it. The general rule for Narration
is: In writing history select details with reference
to their significance and their truth; in fiction
with reference to their significance and their probability.
In every case, significance is an essential
quality. It is so easy to confound minuteness
with subtlety; to suppose that to be finical is to be
true; to assume that to be exact is to be effective;
that more than one gifted author has come to grief
and has wasted his powers through these errors.
The measure of subtlety, of truth, and of effectiveness,
is the relative value as measured by the central
idea of the composition.</p>

<p>The order of events in a narrative depends
chiefly upon the principle of cause and effect.
Since every cause produces its effect, it follows
that the sequence of incidents will generally be
practically chronological. Where there are a number
of threads involved and the plot is complicated,
a good deal of ingenuity is often required to keep
things clear, and to secure at the same time a continuous
progression in the narrative. This is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
problem with which the historian has almost always
to deal, and upon his cleverness in solving it depends
much of his success. The only rule to be
given is that the writer shall have a careful and
definite plan. In a simple tale it is often possible
to depend upon the knowledge of the end to be
reached, and to trust to one&rsquo;s instinct for the rest.
With an intricate theme this will not do. If one
is driving a mild-mannered horse in a light wagon,
it is usually enough to know the general direction,
since it is possible from time to time to stop to
inquire the way; in running a complicated system
of railway trains the same method would be madness.</p>

<p>One matter involved in this question of the order
of incidents is that of where and how a story shall
begin. Often it is wise to commence with a striking
incident or situation, and it is rare that a story
can be effectively begun without there being more
or less which must be told of what has gone before
the actual tale. Much care is needed in managing
this. It is one of the simplest devices, and it remains
one of the most effective which have been
devised, to have all explanations of this sort made
to some personage in the tale instead of to the
reader directly. If a story start with the striking
appearance of the hero in some extraordinary situation,
it is much more effective and pleasing to
have the spectators, those who in the narrative
are represented as seeing him, ask and obtain information
in regard to his past and to the events
which brought him to this place or situation, than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
it is for the author in a deliberate manner to set
out to inform the reader.</p>

<p>Never presume on the reader&rsquo;s patience and indulgence.
The &ldquo;gentle reader&rdquo; of old-fashioned
literature does not exist now, if indeed he ever
existed. The modern reader is far more ready to
be bored than to be interested, and all devices for
persuading and holding his attention must be carefully
attended to.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>Of essential importance in story-telling is movement.
This is an advantage in other forms of
composition, but indispensable in Narration. There
can be no sense of unity, no continuity of interest,
unless there is a constant sense of progression. A
story can no more stand still than can life. When
the incidents cease to carry the reader forward,
it is as if the heart stopped beating. Each incident
in a narrative, as in existence, must stand
in relation to what comes before it of effect to
cause, and to what follows it of cause to effect.
It is necessary to make the reader feel that he is
ever going forward, now slowly and now swiftly,
according to the exigencies of the tale. Contrast,
variety, relative importance, have all to be considered.
When the reader is eager to reach some
culmination, when he is excited in regard to some
crisis in the narrative, it is often wise to condense
days into a sentence, hours into a phrase. Again,
there are times when it is important to prepare the
mind for a situation, to go slowly in order that an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
effect be produced by the cumulative force of trifles.
No hard-and-fast rule can be given to govern this
progression. The technical means by which swiftness
or deliberation are secured are simple and
easily learned. The whole matter is pretty well
covered by the statement that many words and
minute details retard movement, while few words
and a suppression of particulars give rapidity.
When to employ these means the writer must learn
from the study of the work of the masters, from
the careful consideration of what result he wishes
to insure, and above all by a close examination of
the manner in which effects are produced in real
life. Naturally, the movement is swifter as the tale
nears its conclusion, and in passages which deal
with exciting and intense emotions. Illustrations
are hardly possible in limited space, but the climax
of any masterpiece may serve as an example.</p>

<p>Description and dialogue must be subordinate to
the movement of a story, as they must be subordinate
to the general purpose. Speaking broadly,
dialogue aids swiftness of progression, and description
delays it; yet an over-abundance of talk may
retard as effectually as profuse word-painting.
With dialogue we shall have to do later, and here
it is enough to say that talk which really belongs
to the tale, which helps the story forward, adds
sprightliness to the movement. We all know how
the elder Dumas makes dialogue increase the vivacity
and the rapidity of movement of his dashing
romances. What can be told in the speech of the
characters in a narrative seems generally to go forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
with more briskness than what is related in
the words of the author.</p>

<p>The mention of Description brings us to the
scene of a narrative. The setting of a tale is not
unlike the mounting of a play. When the use of
nature in fiction was fresher than now the affair
was very simple. It was only necessary to bring
in gloomy skies and wailing winds as accompaniments
for a doleful situation, or to have the flowers,
the sunshine, and the birds properly specified when
things were going happily. The birds sang most
obligingly for the old novelists, utterly ignoring
the habits which ornithologists had with painful
care observed,&mdash;they warbled when they were
wanted, although they were called upon at times
of day when they had never before dreamed of
piping up:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Singing gladly all the moontide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never waiting for the noontide.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">In less artistic fiction there is still something of
this method. There are many transiently popular
novels where in the closing chapter the autumn
rain still falls dismally upon a lonely grave, or the
summer sun&mdash;the June sun&mdash;and the obliging
dicky-birds decorate the wedding of the long-persecuted
but at last triumphant heroine, transcendently
lovely in white satin.</p>

<p>In really serious work the matter has become
more intricate. Nature must be used without the
appearance of design. It is recognized that no
man can command the weather, and the trick of
seeming to manage the elements is no longer tolerated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Art must conceal art. Even contrasts
have been used until it is necessary to be very
cautious in employing them. The villains no longer
steal through smiling gardens whose snowy lilies,
all abloom, and sending up perfume like incense
from censers of silver, seem to rebuke the wicked.
The thing sought now is the appearance of naturalness.
Simplicity and directness are the prime
qualities to be kept in mind. Set a story carefully,
but above all things be sure that it does not appear
that pains have been taken. The finest art is that
which works with apparent frankness, seeming to
display its methods without disguise, yet in reality
producing its effects by a skill which is utterly
beyond perception.</p>

<p>One of the faults most common with beginners
is self-consciousness. The inexperienced writer is
apt to show that he is not sure how what he writes
will be received. Cultivate the attitude of being
conscious of nothing but the story to be told.
Above all, do not seem to apologize. In fiction as
elsewhere apologies are apt to breed contempt. The
writer who seems to plead to be excused inevitably
suggests that there is need of excuse. Tell a story
or leave it, but never take the middle course of
telling it with apologies, direct or indirect. Often
the self-conscious author shows that he secretly
fears that he will be thought to lack cleverness if
he allows himself so to be imposed upon by his
characters as to think them real. If they are not
real to him he should not be telling their history.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
The slightest appearance of doubt on his part ruins
all illusion and the story along with it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is a mistake to expect the
reader to share an emotion simply from being told
that it is felt by the writer. Every phrase like &ldquo;I
felt,&rdquo; &ldquo;I was amused,&rdquo; &ldquo;I was enraged,&rdquo; and so
on, which is not amply supported by the narrative,
weakens the effect. It is generally enough to destroy
the entire flavor of any ordinary witticism to
tell the reader that it is droll. It sometimes will
do to say that the characters of the tale thought
a thing funny, but even this is a somewhat dangerous
expedient. If a thing does not strike the
reader as amusing, it is of little use to inform him
that it is his duty to find it so. An author has no
business to put himself in the attitude of a verger
who leads pilgrims from one historic spot to another,
saying in effect at each, &ldquo;Here it is necessary
that you feel yourselves thrilled!&rdquo;</p>

<p>When everything else has been said, the essential
thing in regard to Narration is that it shall
be interesting. It is the old question of Force.
&ldquo;Tediousness,&rdquo; observes Dr. Johnson, with his
usual sententiousness, &ldquo;is the most fatal of faults.&rdquo;
He might have added that it is a fault so serious
that it overcomes all excellences. Macaulay inquires,
&ldquo;Where lies the secret of being amusing?
and how is it that art, eloquence, and diligence may
all be employed in making a book dull?&rdquo; Dullness
is less easily forgiven in narrative than in
any other form of composition. The avowed aim
of a story is to entertain; and if it fail of this, its
merits count for nothing. The specific methods by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
which interest may be secured or increased must be
studied with the realization that the very existence
of narrative depends upon them.</p>

<p>The first point is to be interested one&rsquo;s self. In
other words, the first great secret is earnestness.</p>

<p>The second is closely allied to it. It is to be perfectly
straightforward. This secret is sincerity.</p>

<p>The first of these calls for the telling of a thing
as if the writer really cares for it, as if it is something
which seems to him richly worth relating;
while the second insists that he shall treat his
readers with every appearance of frankness. He
shall appear to conceal nothing which it is for the
interest of the tale for him to tell, and he shall try
to take no advantage by telling that of which he
is not himself completely persuaded, nothing which
does not seem to him a vital portion of the history,
real or fictitious, which he set out to relate.
Hawthorne, when asked the secret of his style,
said: &ldquo;It is the desire to tell the simple truth as
honestly and as vividly as one can.&rdquo; Many entire
books on rhetoric have less wisdom in them than
is in this single sentence.</p>

<p>Making a somewhat different division of the
subject, we may say that interest in Narration
comes from three sources: the plot, the incident,
and the development of character. The story
which depends upon plot alone goes by quickly.
Only while it has novelty can it command attention,
and it is scarcely to be read a second time.
The tale which depends upon incident alone&mdash;if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
there be such&mdash;would be not unlike a book of
anecdotes, too fragmentary to be effective as a
whole. That in which the drawing of character
is the chief feature is likely to be heavy and sure
to be restricted to a limited audience. In the
masterpiece, plot, incident, and character-drawing
are combined. The great novelists have never
essentially varied in their methods, and in the work
of Cervantes, Fielding, Thackeray, Hawthorne, and
the rest, style, character, and story are all integral
parts of the whole.</p>

<p>It is perhaps not amiss to say here a word in
regard to the collection of material and to what is
meant by the study of nature. I have already
repeated the truism that the writer must ever be
on the alert for material. If he is to write stories
he is to undertake the reproduction of human life,
and it is above all needful that he understand
human life. He cannot be too careful in his consideration
of the world about him. He must be
constantly examining the acts of his fellow men;
constantly saying to himself: &ldquo;What were the motives
which led to that act? What were the feelings
aroused by that experience? What the emotions
in such a situation?&rdquo; He must make his
own inner experience the test, and from the less
divine the greater. He may to a great extent
judge the motives which actuate men and women
in important crises from those which have moved
him in circumstances seemingly trivial. A well-known
New England story-teller said to me once
when I praised a tale in which she had shown most
vividly the remorse of a man who had committed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
a great crime: &ldquo;It will amuse you to hear how I
knew what that man&rsquo;s feelings were. Once when
I was a child I burned up my sister&rsquo;s doll in a fit
of anger. The remorse I suffered over that foolish
performance was the material that I made my story
out of.&rdquo; There is a good illustration of the way in
which the creative mind works. From the nature
of its own emotions it is able to appreciate the
feelings of others, and to see that in feeling there
is more question of degree than of kind. His own
being is the only one into which a writer can
really look. What he finds in his own heart is
the key by which to read the cipher which is written
in the hearts of others.</p>

<p>Narration is the form of literature which most
universally appeals to men, and it is no less that
form which most affects human conduct. Men who
could not be brought to give ear to a sermon may
be taught by a parable or moved by a tale. It is
in narrative that prose rises most surely and indisputably
to the rank of a fine art, so that while the
masterpieces of fiction remain it will be impossible
to question the right of prose literature to claim a
place beside painting, sculpture, music, and poetry.
Art is the regenerator of the world, and in modern
times it is in the form of fiction that it most easily
and most widely reaches the hearts of men.</p>

<p class="captitle">ACCESSORIES OF NARRATION</p>


<p>The range of Narration is so wide that it is well
to look a little more carefully at the means of
producing effects in this especial department of
composition. The subject is at once so fascinating
and so complicated that it would not be difficult
to make an entire course of lectures upon it,
although in the end we might be brought to the
humiliating consciousness that no amount of lecturing
could make novelists of us. In the limits of
these talks it is impossible to do more than to consider
briefly the more important matters which
occupy the attention of the story-teller; and those
which first come to mind are the things which it is
customary to name Local Color, Dialect, Dialogue,
Character Drawing, and Moral Purpose.</p>

<p>Local color in the modern sense was invented in
the present century. It is true that the writers of
other times had employed the same device before,
but it has been consciously sought and has been
supplied with this name within recent times. It
might be asked by a cynic why the quality is any
better now that it is ticketed and talked about in
reviews than it was in the days of Theocritus and
Kalidasa and Boccaccio; but so many things have
been used before modern generations were thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
of that if we are not to have the privilege of regarding
things as new when they have been newly
named we are likely to be at a desperate loss for
novelty.</p>

<p>By local color is now meant the bringing out of
the peculiarities of the locality where the scene of
a tale is laid. It is evident that there is no spot
so poor as not to have characteristics which distinguish
it from all others. It is the aim of many
modern story-tellers to give this especial local flavor
with the most faithful and often painful vividness.
Indeed, there are not a few recent stories
which seem to exist for no other reason than to exploit
the accidental qualities of remote and hitherto
undescribed places.</p>

<p>This is an age in which competition between
periodicals has waxed warm, and to the desire of
editors to procure novelties is largely due the increase
of the already rather tiresomely abundant
examples of local color and of dialect. An air of
freshness may be imparted to a tale by laying
the scene in places practically unknown in fiction.
Accidents of custom and manners arrest the attention
for the moment, and it is due to this fact that
the great mass of stories marked by this peculiarity
have succeeded. The principle is not unlike that
of drawing a crowd to the theatre by new scenery.
A tale which is really vital can do without local
color, as a really strong play succeeds without
elaborate setting.</p>

<p>This is not, however, the whole of the matter.
A good play may be helped by novel effects of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
scenery and a tale good in itself may be improved
by local color. Detailed description of local peculiarities
may make more clear to the reader the
character and the motives of the personages in a
narrative. All men are influenced by their surroundings,
and to be familiar with unusual social
conditions is often essential to the understanding of
acts or opinions which have been done or held under
them. To make intelligible the story of Hester
Prynne and Arthur Dimmesdale, Hawthorne was
obliged to set forth something of the manners and
morals of colonial days. Scott could not have
made comprehendable the tale of Rob Roy without
giving some idea of what life in the Highlands
was like in the time of that redoubtable chieftain.
The author must in any case impart to the reader
whatever special information is necessary to the
best effect of his fiction.</p>

<p>The comment which it seems fair to make in
this connection is that here is to be applied the
rule which should govern the management of all
details in narration,&mdash;namely, that everything
shall be kept subordinate to the central purpose
of the work. So long as particular description
aids in bringing out more clearly the main idea of
the whole, so long as it is used as a means and
not as an end, so long as the setting is kept subordinate
to the story, so long it is good. The
moment what is called local color is allowed to
dominate a story, it must injure the permanent
effect. The literary mechanic who is writing stories
simply to sell them will usually find it easy to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
dispose of studies of local peculiarities which are
piquant, whether they are true or not. There is
nothing to object to in this, but this work is not
to be confounded with legitimate Narration, and it
is not to be looked upon as permanent literature.
Local color is accidental rather than essential. It
depends upon circumstances which belong to a
place rather than to human nature. It follows
that it is not in itself of permanent interest, and
that work depending upon it for interest must go
by as soon as the novelty is passed. The work of
Miss Wilkins, Miss Jewett, Miss Brown, and the
rest, has attracted attention through the fidelity
with which it presented peculiarities of New England
rural life. The claim to permanent value in
each, however, rests on other and higher grounds.
In so far as they are true to the fundamental and
essential characteristics of humanity, in so far as
they deal with the constant emotions of men and
women as men and women, and not as eccentric
types evolved by peculiarities and environment,
they have permanent value&mdash;and no farther.</p>

<p>Closely allied with local color, and indeed in
many cases hardly to be distinguished from it, is
dialect. We are all familiar with a certain strange
appearance which has of late years come over the
pages of the magazines, a sort of epidemic of which
the most prominent characteristics are the misspelling
of words and a plentiful spattering of apostrophes,
as if the secret of literary art lay in eccentric
and intermittent orthography. We have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
been instructed that these startling productions
were dialect stories, and whether we have professed
to like them or not has depended largely upon our
daring to say what we thought. There are, it is
true, dialect stories which we must all admire and
enjoy,&mdash;many of them in spite of their strange
language rather than because of it,&mdash;but none the
less is the multiplicity of tales in dialect a visitation
not unlike the Egyptian plague of swarming
flies or of sprawling frogs.</p>

<p>The object of the use of dialect is of course to
produce what might be called a personal local
color. To personages who belong to nationalities
other than his own a writer often gives phrases
in their own tongue or conforming to the idiom
of their own language in order to convey a lively
impression of their being foreigners. To produce
a vivid sense of the fact that his characters are
Creoles of New Orleans and to suggest all the romantic
flavor of life among them, George Cable
used dialect in that delightful book, &ldquo;Old Creole
Days;&rdquo; to make the reader realize the especial
local and race peculiarities of one character or another
Thomas Nelson Page used one negro dialect
in &ldquo;Marse Chan&rdquo; and Joel Chandler Harris another
in &ldquo;Uncle Remus.&rdquo; In these and similar cases the
dialect used is really, as far as the general reader
is concerned, an unknown tongue. Its correctness
or incorrectness cannot be judged by the general
public to which these tales are addressed, and its
use must therefore be flavor rather than accuracy,
impression rather than information, picturesqueness
rather than literalness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>The proper use of dialect is often a great aid in
characterization. Some figures it is all but impossible
to individualize without this means. There
are figures in Scott which would not be at all the
same thing if stripped of their dialect; while in
each of the stories mentioned above there are instances
of the same thing. It is to be remembered,
however, that this is a subsidiary purpose. In
other words it is a detail of fiction. Dialect is
written for the sake of the story, and woe to that
author who produces a story for the sake of a
dialect. The tales of the &ldquo;Soldiers Three,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;Window in Thrums,&rdquo; &ldquo;Old Creole Days,&rdquo; succeed
for other qualities than the dialect, and the
dialect is good because it helps to make effective
something better. It is even not improbable that
with a large body of readers these and kindred
books succeed only in spite of their dialect, since
even at its best this perversion of language is apt
to be in itself somewhat irritating even if not
perplexing.</p>

<p>Actually to reproduce a dialect as it is spoken
is a feat so difficult that it is worse than idle to
attempt it outside of works on philology. Dialectic
peculiarities are always largely matters of accent,
of voice quality, and of inflection. The sounds of
vowels and consonants may be indicated, but it is
all but impossible to set down the rising and falling
of the voice which is the most characteristic
quality of these forms of speech. Printed words
cannot reproduce that species of intoning which
has so large a share in making unintelligible to
foreigners the speech of London cabmen and porters.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
Indeed, it is to be doubted whether any
written dialect is to be regarded as a very exact
reproduction of the genuine thing,&mdash;a statement
which would probably be regarded with contemptuous
anger by the devotees of the dialect story, if any
still survive. Certainly it is true that dialect does
not have to be genuine to be successful. The dialect
of the &ldquo;Biglow Papers&rdquo; was never spoken on
the face of the earth. It is none the worse for that,
so far as I can see. It has the effect for which it
was intended, and nothing more could reasonably be
asked. Mr. Lowell made it with the most careful
patience, and apparently believed in it with beautiful
faith. He set nothing down, or rather he tried
to set nothing down, which he had not heard from
the lips of Yankee rustics; but in the first place
no one man ever used all those distorted words and
phrases, belonging sometimes to different localities;
and in the second, letters cannot reproduce
the peculiar sounds and accents of rural New England.
Yet this dialect has imposed for a quarter of
a century upon no inconsiderable portion of the
American reading public, and it will probably continue
to impose upon English readers until the end
of time.</p>

<p>The inability of readers to judge of the accuracy
of dialect is inseparable from its use. How many
are acquainted with the vernacular of &ldquo;Thrums,&rdquo;
the patois of New Orleans Creoles, the dialect of
Mexican mining camps, or the speech of the half-breeds
of Canada or the West Indian islands?
No danger that the general reader will measure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
work by reality obliges the writer of dialect to
be accurate. The only restraining influence is the
difficulty of making a manufactured dialect consistent
and convincing. The story-teller studies dialect
as it is spoken, not for the sake of being right,
but because this is the surest way to obtain the
appearance of being right. The only essential
thing is to be convincing.</p>

<p>The danger in the use of dialect is not far to
seek. Its literary value is that of flavor. As long
as this fact is recognized it may properly be employed.
The difficulty is that the great and inglorious
company of imitators have written dialect
for its own sake,&mdash;or perhaps for their own sake!&mdash;and
thereby not only have produced things
dreadful to contemplate, but have so wearied the
soul of readers that it has become dangerous to
use it legitimately. Dialect in literature is a condiment
and not a viand; it is mustard and not
beef; it is never to be employed for its own sake
any more than are commas and capitals, paragraphs
and periods. Almost every inexperienced writer
who tries his hand at dialect&mdash;and most experienced
ones&mdash;will overdo it. The French, with
their instinctive literary sense, may well be studied
in this connection. They understand that the value
of patois is its suggestiveness, and they go in its
use just so far as is necessary to impart the flavor
required, and there they stop. This is the legitimate
method. I have nothing to say of those disfigurements
which appear in some of the periodicals,
sketches which are written for the sake of exhibiting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
a special dialect. They do not come under
the head of literature except in the sense in which
the word includes the dictionary and thesaurus.
They may be of interest to the student of philology,
but they cannot concern the imaginative
reader.</p>

<p>The best quality which dialect can give is an impression
of individuality, of quaintness or remoteness
from conventional and hackneyed experiences.
It must be written with care and sobriety. The
writer must remember that the day is definitely
past when it was possible to produce effects simply
by misspelling. It is well to keep in mind also
that even the ability to write a dialect never so
perfectly is not necessarily a reason for using it.
The employment of local forms of language, like
local color, must be subordinate to the purposes of
the story. It is always a means and never legitimately
an end. It is, moreover, a good deal discredited
by over-use and abuse, so that it must be
employed with double caution.</p>

<p>One more word of warning it seems well to add.
The employment of dialect and of local color as
a means of producing literary effect is apt to impart
to work a transient character. Their effect is
less likely to be permanently pleasing than that of
almost any other thing legitimately among the resources
of the story-teller. The principle that it
is well to appeal to ordinary experiences and to ordinary
tastes comes in here. The general reader
soon tires of dialect unless it be very simple and is
supported by all other devices within the range of
art. To write dialect is likely to be at best to sacrifice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
permanent to temporary success. The greatest
writers have usually employed it sparingly.
Shakespeare almost never resorted to it; Fielding
scarcely used it at all; Scott tried it much more
largely, but the Scotch speech was all but universal
among his people, and it has certainly been
oftener a hindrance than a help to his continued
success; Thackeray put little of it into his best
work; Hawthorne passed it by; and even Dickens
depended upon it very little, despite the temptations
which his characters constantly offered. Thomas
Hardy has given us the best rustics since Shakespeare
with not much more than an indication of
dialect. I do not wish to insist upon the point too
strongly, but the principle seems to me a sound
one, and it is certainly worth the consideration of
any student of the art of writing fiction.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>The art of writing dialogue is by no means the
least difficult thing which the story-teller has to
learn, and there are very many who are not able to
acquire it to the end of their days. If a rule could
be devised by which good and pleasing dialogue
could be written, it would go far toward making it
possible for every man to be his own novelist. To
give to the talk of a tale the air of naturalness and
ease, to make it take its place in the story and be
attractive without being too clever or too formal,
to give it character and consistency, to impart to
it movement and vivacity, to be sure that it helps
forward the narrative in which it is set,&mdash;all these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
difficulties must be overcome before an author can
be said to write good dialogue.</p>

<p>The first essential in dialogue is naturalness.
Some authors get on without this, but they get on
in spite of lacking it and are constantly hampered
by the lack. The most striking instance of this in
modern fiction is probably George Meredith, a novelist
who makes his way with more encumbrances
than any other living man of genius. Take, for instance,
this bit, chosen almost at random:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;Have you walked far to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nine and a half hours. My Flibbertigibbet is
too much for me at times, and I had to walk off my
temper.&rdquo; &hellip;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All those hours were required?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not quite so long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are training for your alpine tour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s doubtful whether I shall get to the Alps this
year. I leave the Hall, and shall probably be in London
with a pen to sell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Willoughby knows that you leave him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;As much as Mont Blanc knows that he is going to
be climbed by a party below. He sees a speck or two
in the valley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has spoken of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He would attribute it to changes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
&mdash;<i>The Egotist</i>, viii.<br />
</p></div>

<p class="noindent">This does as a matter of fact somewhat help forward
the story from which it is taken, but could
anybody get from it the idea that two living beings
were talking together?</p>

<p>The great principle of the impression of truth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
instead of a servile imitation of truth is the secret
of good talk in fiction. It is necessary to keep
clear on the one hand of formality and stiffness,
and on the other of stupid closeness in mere imitation.
In actual talk there are inaccuracies,
broken sentences, phrases of which the meaning is
evident from some glance or gesture, repetitions
and careless constructions, all of which would lose
their force or gain undue importance if set down
in print. To preserve or too closely to imitate
these characteristics of genuine conversation is to
give an impression of unreality, or commonplaceness
and even of vulgarity. The rambling speech
is often pleasantly and appropriately imitated. The
inimitable Nurse in &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; stands at
the head of talkers of this sort, but there are excellent
specimens in the fiction of our own century.
Miss Austen possessed the secret of this futile volubility
to perfection, and Mrs. Stowe&rsquo;s best literary
work is her management of the discursive talk of
Sam Lawson.</p>

<p>That conversation should be in keeping with the
characters speaking is one of those things so obvious
that it is unsafe to leave them unsaid. It is
another application of the principle of the point
of view. The natural tendency of the beginner is
to put into the mouths of his personages not what
they would say but what he would have them say.
If he sufficiently realize them in his own mind
there will be little danger of this. The remedy is
to know his characters. The people in any book
will talk consistently if they are real to the author.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
They will say what they wish to say and not what
he wishes them to say, and that is the whole secret.</p>

<p>Most young writers compose pages of dialogue
which seems to them clever, which, when it is written,
they read over with tender admiration, generally
not without a little amazement that they have
done so well and a conviction that this at least imparts
distinction to their book,&mdash;when as a matter
of fact the whole thing is simply an amateurish
mistake. It is one of the many pitfalls which egotism
and inexperience dig for the unwary writer,
who forgets that success can be achieved only when
the end of a work is the work and not the worker.
The elaborator of his own opinions into the form
of talk is not writing dialogue; he is but making
a weak concession to his individual vanity. His
punishment is that he cannot deceive the public.
Readers may not know their right hands from their
left, but they know when they are bored, and they
are always bored when the progress of the tale is
interrupted to afford an author opportunity to display
himself.</p>

<p>Anthony Trollope puts this matter well in his
&ldquo;Autobiography:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is no portion of a novelist&rsquo;s work in which
this fault of episodes is so common as in dialogue.
It is so easy to make two persons talk on any casual
subject with which the writer presumes himself to be
conversant! Literature, philosophy, politics, or sport
may be handled in a loosely discursive style; and the
writer, while indulging himself, is apt to think he is
pleasing the reader. I think he can make no greater
mistake. The dialogue is generally the most agreeable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
part of a novel; but it is only so as long as it tends in
some way to the telling of the main story. It need
not seem to be confined to this, but it should always
have a tendency in this direction. The unconscious
critical acumen of a reader is both just and severe.
When a long dialogue on extraneous matter reaches
his mind, he at once feels that he is being cheated into
taking something that he did not bargain to accept
when he took up that novel. He does not at that moment
require politics or philosophy, but he wants a story.
He will not, perhaps, be able to say in so many words
that at some certain point the dialogue has deviated
from the story; but when it does he will feel it.&mdash;Ch.
xii.</p></div>

<p>Of course the matter is made more complicated
by the fact that it is often the office of dialogue to
indicate character rather than action. How far the
writer may introduce talk simply to illustrate mental
characteristics or moods is a thing to be decided
by each writer for himself and learned by observation.
It is not amiss for a young writer to consider
carefully how far he is himself able to enjoy
this in the work of others; and in any case he
must learn to distinguish between what is written
genuinely to illustrate mental traits and that which
is really put in simply to show his own cleverness.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>There are two points in the writing out of dialogue
which it is well to keep in mind: first that
care must be taken never to leave the reader in
doubt who is speaking, and second that interspersed
comments be used with skillful nicety.</p>

<p>In a conversation which consists of a somewhat
extended succession of short speeches it is often hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
for the reader to keep in mind without effort who
say them, unless they are labeled; while on the
other hand to come upon a constant repetition of
&ldquo;said he,&rdquo; &ldquo;said she,&rdquo; &ldquo;said Tom,&rdquo;
&ldquo;said Jane,&rdquo;
is as irritating as bumping over a corduroy bridge
in a cart without springs. It is worth the author&rsquo;s
while to take all possible pains to give explicit indication
of the personality of the speaker wherever
this is needed and equally to omit it where it is
superfluous. Here is an example from a second-rate
novel:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off on Monday,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not really,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have only come to say good-by,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall you be gone long?&rdquo; asked she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That depends,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to know what takes you away,&rdquo; said
she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; said he, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if I know,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say you might guess,&rdquo; said he.</p></div>

<p>There are so many devices for avoiding repetition
that only gross carelessness can commit a fault
like this. The abundance of terms which may be
used&mdash;said, remarked, observed, replied, returned,
retorted, asked, inquired, demanded, murmured,
grumbled, growled, sneered, explained, exclaimed,
and the rest of the long list of words of allied meanings&mdash;leaves
the writer of English without excuse
if he fail to vary the words of specification in dialogue.
There are, too, many ways of evading the
need of employing any of these. Frequently the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
nature of the talk indicates sufficiently the speaker;
and it is often possible and well to introduce the
name of the character addressed. The simple device
of altering the relative position of the verb
and the subject is not to be despised. In the extract
just given the ear would receive as a relief
and a boon a single &ldquo;he said&rdquo; among so many
&ldquo;said he&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Opening Stevenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Treasure
Island&rdquo; almost at random, and taking the words
on a couple of pages which indicate the speakers
and their utterances, I find these:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Observed Silver&hellip;. Cried the cook&hellip;. Returned
Morgan&hellip;. Said another&hellip;. Cried Silver&hellip;.
Said Merry&hellip;. Agreed Silver&hellip;.
Said Morgan&hellip;. Said the fellow with the bandage&hellip;.
Observed another.</p></div>

<p>On a couple of pages of one of Hardy&rsquo;s books
the phrases are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Said a young married man&hellip;. Murmured Joseph&hellip;.
Dashed in Mark Clark&hellip;. Added Joseph&hellip;.
Said Henry&hellip;. Observed Mr. Mark&hellip;. Whispered
Joseph&hellip;. Said Mr. Oak&hellip;. Continued
Joseph.</p></div>

<p>The variety does not come by chance, but by
care and a finely trained perception of the value of
trifles. It is of importance that the exact significance
and intensity of the verb employed be taken
into account. There is a distinct difference between
&ldquo;dashed in&rdquo; and &ldquo;continued;&rdquo; between
&ldquo;cried&rdquo; and &ldquo;exclaimed.&rdquo; The author should
have a sense of the mood and manner of his personages
so clear and so fine that only one of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
the possible words shall seem to him fit. If his dialogue
is at all related to real life, it will so vary
in its fine shadings that the terms indicating the manner
of utterance will vary naturally and inevitably.</p>

<p>The interspersion of comments in dialogues is another
matter of detail which greatly increases or lessens
the finish of work. It is often possible to give a
much more lively and vivid presentation of the speakers
if amid their talk are mixed bits of action or even
of description. The two things to be observed are
that there shall not be too much of this and that
the interpolations shall be significant. The movement
of the current of conversation must not be
hindered. Trifles may be effectively used, yet it is
one of the most difficult points of literary art so to
use them. It is a good thing for the student to
write little sketches in dialogue form; stories in
which he is forced to depend almost entirely upon
the talk itself for characterization and narrative.
Readers as a rule do not care much for this sort of
thing, and it is to be done as part of the training
of the workman rather than for itself. To sum up
this matter, it may be said that in interspersing
comment, as in all else that has to do with dialogue,
the great secret lies in realizing the persons
speaking and in allowing them to utter their own
words, instead of making them speak the words of
the author or stand aside while the author expresses
his thoughts himself.</p>

<p class="captitle">CHARACTER AND PURPOSE</p>

<p>The secret of character-drawing of course lies
largely in the ability to understand and to appreciate
character, but in its application to practical
work it largely resolves itself into the power of
realizing the personages of the tale. A striking
example of how a vitalizing imagination can and
may make the actors in a fiction real in spite of
all drawbacks is furnished by George Meredith.
George Meredith&rsquo;s style is a teasing madness; his
characters talk as no human beings ever dreamed
of talking; and yet these personages are so actual,
so individual, so human, that it is impossible not
to feel that if one of them were pricked, real, red,
warm human blood would flow. They existed so
vividly for the author that they exist vividly for
the reader and convince in spite of all the author&rsquo;s
mannerisms. The relation of an author to his
puppets has been well put by Trollope when he
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The novelist has other aims than the elucidation of
his plot. He desires to make his readers so intimately
acquainted with his characters that the creatures of
his brain should be to them speaking, moving, living,
human creatures. This he can never do unless he
know those fictitious personages himself, and he can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
never know them unless he can live with them in the
full reality of established intimacy&hellip;. He must learn
to hate them and to love them. He must argue with
them, quarrel with them, forgive them, and even submit
to them.&mdash;<i>Autobiography</i>, xiii.</p></div>

<p>Deliberate description of persons is seldom of
much effect. Says Stevenson:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Readers cannot fail to have remarked that what an
author tells us of the beauty or the charm of his creatures
goes for naught; that we know instantly better;
that the heroine cannot open her mouth but what, all
in a moment, the fine phrases of preparation fall from
her like the robes from Cinderella, and she stands before
us, self-betrayed, as a poor, ugly, sickly wench, or
perhaps a strapping market-woman.&mdash;<i>A Gossip on a
Novel of Dumas&rsquo;s.</i></p></div>

<p class="noindent">The same principle holds with mental traits. It is
of little use to announce, and especially to announce
early in a tale, what the character of an actor is.
If the author declare that the fictitious person is
this or that, he gives the reader a measure by
which to criticise his performance. He puts into
the hands of his public a rod wherewith to scourge
him for whatever falls short of intention,&mdash;and
if tried for falling short of intention, who shall
escape? If the reader is left to judge of character
by deeds, he becomes himself responsible for any
opinions which he may choose to hold. The rule
which every student should adopt for himself is
that character is to be indicated first by the acts of
the personages in a tale, and secondly by their talk.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Description of character may be suggested, but it
should not be direct if it is possible to avoid this.</p>

<p>Of course I do not mean that there may not be a
good deal of direct comment on character. I do
mean, however, that while it will probably entertain
the author to write this and may help him in
understanding the people about whom he writes,
the effect upon the reader will in most cases be
exceedingly small. If you are in the habit of
analyzing your mental experiences, I am confident
that you will bear me out in saying that we
are seldom much affected by any declaration on
the part of the writer that a character is good, bad,
or indifferent. If we have drawn the same conclusion
from the story, that is from the events and
the conversations, we may agree with the author;
if we have not, we do not in the least accept his
estimate.</p>

<p>This may seem a covert attack upon the whole
school of analytical fiction, but it is meant merely
to be a warning to practical workers. There is
nothing in all literary art more enticing to a novelist
than the vivisection of character, and especially
in this introspective age is it difficult to write
objectively and without what might be called mental
rummaging. It is impossible not to feel that all
this minute analysis of character, however interesting
as psychological tract or treatise, distinctly injures
the effect of a work as a whole. It changes the
characters from living beings to subjects on the
dissecting-table, and destroys the vitality of the
tale. It is in our time the prevailing fashion, but
it is of our time no less the literary disease. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
the masterpieces of fiction it is seldom found; and
the book which is heavily weighted with analysis is
desperately sure of going soon to the bottom of the
pool of oblivion, no matter by how much wit or
wisdom it may be buoyed up.</p>

<p>Often a single significant detail will throw more
light on a character than pages of comment. An
example in perfection is the phrase in which Thackeray
tells how Becky Crawley, amid all her guilt
and terror, when her husband had Lord Steyne by
the throat, felt a sudden thrill of admiration for
Rawdon&rsquo;s splendid strength. It is like a flash of
lightning which shows the deeps of the selfish, sensual
woman&rsquo;s nature. It is no wonder that Thackeray
threw down his pen, as he confessed that he
did, and cried, &ldquo;That is a stroke of genius!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of drawing characters from life much the same
may be said as in regard to taking incidents from
life. Real characters are excellent points of departure,
and in the study of mental traits it is possible
to hold much more closely to nature than in
the reproduction of incidents. It is easy to pass
the line of probability in incident, but one may go
far before he cross the line of probability in character.
It follows that there is in character much
more material which may be taken directly from
life into fiction, without especial modification. The
chief difficulty here is&mdash;or at least so it seems to
me&mdash;that it is less easy to make an actual person
real in the mind as part of a fiction than it is to
realize a person practically imaginary. If the writer
in his thought and imagination get as perfect a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
conviction of a personage in his story when he is
drawing him directly from life as when he shapes
him from pure imagination, there is no reason why
he should not use the living man as his model, and
often he may in this way gain greater consistency
of development.</p>

<p>Character-drawing belongs rather to novels than
to short stories. The short story practically deals
with character as it shows itself in a crisis or in a
brief and rapid series of events. There is here no
great opportunity for showing the development of
character, but only for exhibiting how character is
manifested under crucial and significant circumstances.
The method must be varied according to
the conditions, and almost perforce the writer of
the short tale is forced to deal chiefly in suggestion,
both of outward and inner conditions and traits,
rather than in extended exposition. In any case,
however, the same fundamental principle holds, that
the clearness of the impression produced upon the
reader depends upon the command of technical
methods which enables a writer to impart what he
feels and upon the sharpness with which he realizes
the character he depicts.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>When there is talk of moral purpose in fiction
most persons are either a little indignant or a good
deal inclined to get out of the way. If they think
how much useless talk has been wasted over the
phrase they are impatient; if they recall how dull
much of this talk has been, they are bored by the
very idea. Indeed, one is sometimes tempted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
take refuge in mere flippancy, and to try to shut
off discussion by declaring that while it is true that
there was formerly such a thing as moral purpose
in literature this has in these degenerate days entirely
given place to an immoral purpose. Yet
despite this impatience the fact remains that the
matter is one of the most important connected
with the art of fiction.</p>

<p>What is generally meant by the question whether
a story shall have a moral purpose is whether it
shall convey an avowed lesson, whether, in short,
it shall be undisguisedly or at least deliberately
didactic. To this there seems to me but one answer
possible, whether from a literary or an ethical
point of view,&mdash;and that is an unqualified negative.
From the point of view of political and social
economics it might appear that this statement is
too sweeping, but closer examination, I believe,
shows it to be sound. Take, for instance, &ldquo;Uncle
Tom&rsquo;s Cabin,&rdquo; a book which has been at least as
widely read as any ever produced in this country.
Whatever may have been the opinion in the
quarter of the century in which the book saw the
light, it would probably be impossible to find to-day
a critic of reputation who would place it above
mediocrity considered simply as literature. As a
means of aiding a great social reform it is one of
the most noteworthy intellectual productions of the
time. Its reputation was of course due largely to
the accidental association with a great political
movement, but its influence makes it a historical
document of the highest possible interest. From
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
the literary point of view its moral purpose is a
mistake, and is a drag upon it; just as the question
of the reform of the Court of Chancery is a drag
upon &ldquo;Bleak House.&rdquo; We may admire the reformatory
effects of these novels, but our interest
in this is historical in so far as it exists at all.</p>

<p>When the critics took Mrs. Humphry Ward to
task for so heavily freighting &ldquo;Robert Elsmere&rdquo;
with metaphysical discussion and disquisition, that
lady published a defense of her methods. She declared
that she could not &ldquo;try to reflect the time
without taking account of forces which are at least
as real and living as other forces, and have as much
to do with the drama of human existence.&rdquo; She
misses the real point. She assumes that the objection
is to the choice of subject which she has
made in writing her book. The trouble is not
simply that she has concerned herself with theological
scruples. It is that she has made her moral
obvious as a moral; and, what is of perhaps even
more importance, that she has not the art to make
her theme show through it the fundamentally human
emotions with which, and with which only, art
is properly concerned. It is not the province of
art to deal with the question of limited interests
except as they depend upon and illustrate human
life in its wide meaning. Art cannot stop at so
confined an inquiry as whether a man shall be a
Mohammedan, a Catholic, or a Protestant or an
Agnostic. The novelist who would succeed permanently
must go deeper than that. The essential
principle of conviction which is common to all humanity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
must be shown through the conflict between
differing creeds. Here the matter is that of emotions
and principles general to all men, although
the especial circumstances in which these are exercised
may be particular and individual. In so
far as &ldquo;Robert Elsmere&rdquo; is significant of that passionate
fidelity to truth which is respected by all
mankind it is vital and significant; but it is mistaken
and transient in so far as it is concerned with
the discussion of accidental rather than with general
truth. I use &ldquo;accidental&rdquo; here in a purely
literary sense. I am not estimating the value of
creeds. I mean simply to say that all men as
human beings are not interested in the question
whether Agnosticism or the Church of England is
to be preferred; while every true man is concerned
with the fact that it often costs much for a human
being to follow his most profound inner conviction.</p>

<p>This brings me to what I should say is the first
principle involved in this matter. Literature as
an art should deal with those ethical questions only
which are of universal human interest.</p>

<p>We have noticed already that whatever a reader
is led to do for himself is more real and more vital
than anything which can be done for him. This
principle, carried farther and higher, underlies the
fact that mankind will give little heed to any &ldquo;record
of intellectual conceptions&rdquo; of life, while they
will be moved and led by a &ldquo;reflection of life&rdquo;&mdash;in
other words by those tales which are the embodiment
of human emotions and human passions. To
be told what some man thinks that life should mean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
to us may interest but is not likely to move us
deeply or to change us. To be shown, vitally and
vividly, what life has meant to any human being
can hardly fail to reach our emotions and to affect
the whole mental being. Life can teach more than
any man can teach. The novelist who preaches
is tacitly assuming that his individual belief is of
more value than the inferences which a reader would
draw from a faithful picture of life. The race
avenges itself upon such an egotist. It does not
reason about it, but it lets his book die. Where
is the didactic novel that has outlived its generation?
To be didactic is at best to be temporary.</p>

<p>The very essence of all art is that the motive of
a work shall be inherent in it and not an outside
purpose; but even aside from this, the moral purpose
which shows itself as such defeats its own
object. The lesson which is elaborated for us belongs
in the sermon, and sermons are apt to be
of effect so transient that it is necessary to have a
fresh one at least once a week. The teaching of a
genuine work of art is permanent. It is hardly
conceivable that the race should outlive the teaching
of Dante or Shakespeare. The hypothesis
upon which the &ldquo;moral purpose,&rdquo; so called, is introduced
into fiction is that men shall be moved to
accept its teaching. The objection which it seems
fair to urge against this is that the ethical lesson
conveyed indirectly is so much more effectual; and
that it is not wise to waste the opportunity and to
dull men&rsquo;s minds to the legitimate effects of fiction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>What the sincere novelist does is practically to
say to his reader: &ldquo;Here is a portion of life as it
seems to me it is or might be. I tell you the
whole of its reality or its possibility as far as I can
perceive it. What it means, what is the lesson to
be drawn from it, you must discover for yourself.
In the first place the emotions which I have felt in
writing the tale cannot be directly expressed. I
have endeavored to suggest them, and that is all
that can be done by means of language. In the
second place, the moral of life will be vital only
to him who draws it for himself.&rdquo; Of course it
is impossible to determine how far one novelist or
another would definitely say to himself anything
of this sort; but I believe that this is the position
consciously or unconsciously taken by every serious
writer of fiction.</p>

<p>No conviction, no opinion, no faith is vital which
is not the original growth of the mind which holds
it. We may induce it. We may advance ideas,
we may even formulate views, and suppose that we
have converted another to our own position, be it
intellectual, moral, æsthetic, or religious. We may
have secured a sort of conformity; the other may
even himself suppose that he thinks as we do; but
until he feels that we think as he does there is
little hope that genuine opinions have taken root
in his mind. It is only when the life within him
has consciously put into tangible form its own
belief that he is in any permanent way, in any
real sense, convinced. Conviction which is forced
upon one by deliberately didactic books is like a
costume, assumed willingly or unwillingly as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
case may be, but only an outer covering. Conviction
which is wrought in one by inner emotion in
reading the story of Arthur Pendennis, of Colonel
Newcome, of Effie Deans, of Jean Valjean, of Hester
Prynne, is a change in the very fibre of the
moral being. The one is a view, and the other is
vitality; one is a theory, and the other is belief;
the one is a creed, but the other is character.</p>

<p class="captitle">TRANSLATION</p>

<p>As the intimate intercourse of the inhabitants of
the earth increases, the necessity of setting over literature
from one tongue to another is every day
greater. One nation is no longer content with its
own science or its own literature. Each is greedy
for the intellectual treasures of the whole race.
Whatever of thought, of experience, of imagination
has been recorded by the men of any country,
is of interest to the readers of all, and there
is therefore a steadily increasing demand for versions
of foreign books.</p>

<p>Translation has come to be almost a distinct
profession. The increased exercise of the art has
raised greatly the standard of excellence demanded.
It is true that there is still a great deal of slip-shod
work offered to the public, but even cheapness is
ceasing to be an effectual recommendation for bad
translations when good ones are to be had. It is
now necessary for the writer who makes this his
business to learn his trade pretty thoroughly. The
days of schoolboy renderings are about over, and
some translators, like Miss Katherine Wormeley,
have raised their work to so high a level that it is almost
entitled to take rank with original production.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>Translation is in the mind of the general public
associated with rendering into extremely scraggly
English the &ldquo;Commentaries&rdquo; of Cæsar or the
&ldquo;Æneid&rdquo; of Virgil. Most of us have been through
experiences like that of Betty in &ldquo;A Woodland
Wooing:&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;Just listen to this stuff. I&rsquo;ve got the rest of it,
but I can&rsquo;t make head or tail out of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; demanded Bob.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Him likewise perchance furious alike impelling,
and the spoils of the Ægean deity whatsoever by means
of madness notwithstanding to be about to be sacrificed.&rsquo;
There, that is the very best I can make out
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Bob, with brotherly candor, &ldquo;you
<i>are</i> a muff. That&rsquo;s plain enough. Don&rsquo;t you see:
&lsquo;He also declared himself about to be sacrificed, an
offering to the insatiate Ægean deity; not caring to
live, moreover, impelled by furious madness, but ready
alike to finish and be forgotten.&rsquo; That is as easy as
rolling off a log.&rdquo;&mdash;Ch. iii.</p></div>

<p class="noindent">This idea, however, it is needful to lay aside if the
subject is to be discussed intelligibly, for Translation
has come to be treated as a serious matter, and
to be developed like any other intellectual pursuit.</p>

<p>The first fact to be accepted in considering Translation
is that it is impossible exactly to render into
one language what has been written in another.
The race that has made each tongue has impressed
its own character upon it in every syllable, in every
idiom. It is not difficult to repeat in one speech
the general idea of what is said in another, and for
practical purposes this is often all that is required.
The directions for making a machine, the particulars
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
of a shipment of grain, the questions one
asks in shopping may with no especial difficulty
be changed from language to language. When it
comes to thoughts, and still more when emotions
are to be dealt with, it is impossible to give in two
tongues precisely the same shade of meaning. The
delicate aroma of a piece of literary art is as surely
diminished or lost in translation as a man becomes
a foreigner and noticeably strange when removed
from his own country to another. Even in practical
affairs this is sometimes a serious consideration.
The meaning in different languages of the phrases
most nearly equivalent is so far from being identical
that in important treaties between nations of
differing speech it is necessary to agree beforehand
what tongue shall be considered authoritative in
case of dispute. In scientific books it is common
to find that a translator is forced to add the original
to his version of some sentence or phrase because
there is no exact equivalent. Words cannot
completely express thought in any case, and to this
constant infirmity of language is in translation
added the difficulty that the words of one tongue
cannot accurately represent the precise shade of
idea phrased by another.</p>

<p>Professor Wendell remarks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Each language names ideas in a way peculiarly its
own. The common agreement on arbitrary symbols
that at length results in the vocabulary of any language
is sure to produce symbols that stand for peculiar
aspects of real thoughts and emotions which language
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
tries to define,&mdash;for aspects in other words which differ
from those named by any other tongue; and what
is thus plainly true of words by themselves is just as
true of words in combination&hellip;. In its vocabulary,
in its grammar, in its entirety, each language must
express the lasting meaning of life in aspects different
from those expressed by any other.&mdash;<i>Stelligeri</i>,
p. 103.</p></div>

<p>It follows that the best that a translator can hope
to do is to give the nearest approximation to the
original that the language into which he is changing
it is capable of. The problem is not unlike
that of the engraver who is endeavoring to reproduce
a picture painted with the brush. At every
point he is forced to decide what combination of
lines and spaces will best represent the work before
him. He knows that it is impossible by any
arrangement of lines actually to reproduce the
brush-work of the painter, and so he goes on considering
what effect among those within his reach
most nearly approaches this.</p>

<p>The methods of the translator of course vary
with the nature of the original with which he has
to deal. In rendering documents which have to
do with practical affairs the chief consideration is
strict exactness of idea. If one attempts to translate
a scientific treatise, the most important point
is absolute accuracy. It is in any case necessary
to write correct and clear English, but Force and
Elegance may for the moment be left practically
out of consideration,&mdash;or, rather, are considered
as in importance subordinate to Clearness. To say
in our tongue as precisely as possible what the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
author has said in his is the translator&rsquo;s first care,
and to express, too, the material, literal, scientific
meaning of this as it would appear to a reader of
the original. Here there is no question of atmosphere,
of suggestion, of connotation. The emotional
element of literature may and indeed must
be ignored here. The intellectual quality is the
only thing to be regarded.</p>

<p>All this is comparatively easy. If one knows
the languages from which and into which he is
translating, he should have no especial difficulty in
changing a scientific paper from one to another.
His knowledge of the subject will of course affect
the ease and accuracy of the result; and of course
the comparative richness of the scientific vocabulary
of the languages is to be taken into account.
In general terms, however, this sort of translation
calls for the exercise of the intellectual faculties
only; and whatever depends upon the intellect
may be acquired by any one who has an intellect,
if he choose to take the trouble.</p>

<p>When it is a question of a version in another
tongue of literature in its higher sense the matter
at once becomes more complicated. Here there is
not only the idea to be considered, but the suggestion,
the flavor, the peculiar quality of style and
individuality. There must be an attempt to give
some impression of the effect produced in the original
by euphony, by what we speak of as word-color,
meaning thereby the melody and the peculiar
quality which terms have from suggestions so
subtle that it is all but impossible to analyze them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
All these requirements thrust themselves upon the
translator, and he must struggle to achieve the impossible
in transferring these from one language to
the other. The difficulties of the undertaking are
well illustrated by George Henry Lewes, in the
following passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Words are not only symbols of objects, but centres
of associations; and their suggestiveness depends partly
upon their sound. Thus there is not the slightest difference
in meaning expressed when I say, &ldquo;The dews
of night began to fall,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;The nightly dews commenced
to fall.&rdquo; Meaning and metre are the same;
but one is poetry, the other prose. Wordsworth paints
a landscape in this line:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The river wanders at its own sweet will.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">Let us translate it into other words: &ldquo;The river runneth
free from all restraint.&rdquo; We preserve the meaning,
but where is the landscape? Or we may turn
it thus, &ldquo;The river flows, now here, now there, at
will,&rdquo; which is a very close translation, much closer
than any usually found in a foreign language, where,
indeed, it would in all probability assume some such
form as this, &ldquo;The river, self-impelled, pursues its
course.&rdquo; In these examples we have what is seldom
found in translations, accuracy of meaning expressed in
similar metre; yet the music and the poetry are gone,
because the music and the poetry are organically dependent
upon certain peculiar arrangements of sound
and suggestion.&mdash;<i>Life of Goethe</i>, 2d ed., p. 466.
Quoted in Genung&rsquo;s &ldquo;Practical Rhetoric.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>It is in the rendering of works which belong to
that department of literature to which is given the
name belles-lettres that translation is most difficult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
and also most common. Poetry, fiction, essays,
and kindred forms are most frequently the
subject of the worker at this craft. Here the form
is often of importance as great as that of the idea.
To give merely a literal version of the exact ideas
in the original would do no more toward reproducing
it than a photograph does toward reproducing
the Sistine Madonna or a plaster cast the
Venus of Melos. Indeed, of the formally literal
translation it is hardly too much to say that it really
represents the original no more than a collection
of paint-tubes containing all the colors in a painting
would represent the picture. The value in the
painting lies in the manner in which the tints have
been arranged and varied, blended here and contrasted
there. In literature, the value lies in the
cunning blending and contrasting, the arrangement
and variety with which ideas are presented. Shelley
said of the chant of the archangels which opens
the &ldquo;Prologue in Heaven&rdquo; of Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faust&rdquo;
that not only is it &ldquo;impossible to represent in another
language the melody of the versification,&rdquo;
but that &ldquo;even the volatile strength and delicacy
of the ideas escape in the crucible of translation.&rdquo;
Every one who has attempted to translate a work
of imaginative merit must appreciate this.</p>

<div class="tbreak">   </div>

<p>Of course, the first thing which a translator considers
is the setting over of the ideas from one
tongue to another, yet it seems to me a great mistake
to make first a version which is simply literal,
and then to try to mould it over into forms of literary
grace. Of course, this is a matter which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
must to a certain extent depend upon individual
temperament, but it is certainly true here as in
other work that a phrase or a sentence can be more
readily shaped and modified while it is fresh than
when it has cooled and hardened. Translation is
no mechanical operation, and no mechanical excellence
will suffice. It is therefore well to aim at
excellence of quality from the first, instead of attempting
to add it as it were by an afterthought.</p>

<p>The first and essential requisite in making a
translation is that it be English. By this is meant
not only that it shall be made up of English words.
It is not even sufficient that it be made up of
English words so arranged that they may be understood.
It is necessary that the English shall
be sound and idiomatic. The ideal translation
preserves nothing in its style to indicate that it
was not originally written in the tongue in which
it stands. It is the aim of the translator to approximate
as closely to this standard of excellence
as he is able. The sentence-structure of the German
is more elaborate and more extended than
our own. It is necessary that the translator of
German works do not model his English version
after this peculiarity of the original. The paragraph
structure of the French is peculiarly broken
and brief; yet the writer who sets work over from
French into English is not permitted to let this
fact determine the manner of his paragraphing in
the latter language. Still more important is it
that the idiom of the alien speech shall not leave
its traces upon the style of the translation. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
is the point in which all mechanical training fails.
A friend gave me the other day a copy of the sign
which was placed above the electric-light button in
the chamber that he occupied in a hotel at Geneva:
&ldquo;One is begged on entering the room to press the
button to let the light, and on parting again to
extend it.&rdquo; The man who wrote this rather remarkable
direction knew his vocabulary tolerably
well, but he had no idea of the English idiom.
You have all of you seen innumerable examples of
the same sort of blunder, and it is one which can
be avoided only by an intimate acquaintance with
the tongue into which one is translating.</p>

<p>Of the three great languages with which the
translator is likely to have to do, French is by far
the most idiomatic, German the least, while English
in this respect stands midway between the
other two. The problem in dealing with idioms is
to find in one tongue expressions which are rather
the equivalents of the original than a literal translation.
The most nearly satisfactory renderings of
the plays of Aristophanes which are to be found in
our literature are those of John Hookham Frere,
and they are probably among the least literal.
Aristophanes was one of the most idiomatic of
classic authors, and he indulged in slang as well as
in idiom. To give an impression at all approximating
to that of the original it is necessary constantly
to depart from the exact words of the
Greek text, especially when an attempt is made to
preserve the feeling of the metrical effects of the
comedies. In &ldquo;The Birds,&rdquo; the literal meaning of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
a certain passage is this: &ldquo;Come &hellip; as many
as in the furrows incessantly twitter around the
clods so lightly with blithesome voice.&rdquo; This is
rendered by Frere:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rioting on the furrowed plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Pecking, hopping,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Picking, popping,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the barley newly sown.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The difference between the literal version and
the other is that from the latter the reader gets
something of the impression which the Greek carried
to its auditors, while from the former nothing
is to be obtained beyond the plain and exact
meaning.</p>

<p>Those who have examined the translation of the
&ldquo;Phormio&rdquo; which was furnished to the audience
when that play was acted at Harvard in 1894
found there numerous illustrations of this use of
equivalents in place of exact meaning. The character
of the dialogue made it proper to employ
modern slang to give the impression which the
original conveyed to the audience for which it was
written. Accordingly the Latin phrase which literally
means &ldquo;Gird up your loins&rdquo; was translated
&ldquo;Brace up!&rdquo; &ldquo;Bring the old man&rdquo; was rendered
&ldquo;Trot out your old man!&rdquo; &ldquo;Now what
will be the talk of folk?&rdquo; is made to read &ldquo;Why,
what will Mrs. Grundy say?&rdquo; The whole is an
amusing though perhaps somewhat extreme example
of the modern idea of translating by the
emotional equivalent instead of by the literal equivalent;
of giving the phrase which shall make on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
English-speaking reader the impression made by
the original upon the reader who spoke the tongue
in which the work was first written.</p>

<p>The method of turning foreign works into English
which has until recently been the popular one
is admirably illustrated by the versions of German
novels which have been so successfully made by Mrs.
A. L. Wister. Mrs. Wister once said to a young
woman who applied to her for aid in getting translating
to do, and who justified her application upon
the ground that she was an excellent French and
German scholar: &ldquo;That is not the question. The
thing is whether you are able to write English
well. Anybody can find out the meaning of a
French or German text; that is simply a matter
of using a grammar and a dictionary. The secret
of making an acceptable translation lies in the
ability to express that meaning in good English.&rdquo;
This is admirably said, but it does not cover the
whole ground. It is of the first importance that
the translator write good English, but it is hardly
to be supposed that the use of grammar and lexicon
will give a writer that intimate and sympathetic
acquaintance with foreign idioms without
which it is impossible to make a version satisfactory
in the modern sense.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wister is an excellent example of what
might more correctly be called a &ldquo;paraphraser&rdquo;
than a &ldquo;translator.&rdquo; It has been her custom to
select some popular German novel, and from that
to make a story which seemed to her likely to
please the American public. She has allowed herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the widest liberty, even to the extent, if I am
not misinformed, of suppressing characters and
modifying situations which did not please her, or
of otherwise altering the story in important particulars.
The success with which her books have
met has justified her practical wisdom in adopting
this method of following literature as a bread-winning
business. She set out to please the
average story-reader, by providing for the market
pleasantly exciting, clean, and entertaining books.
She has done it well, and she has achieved the end
she sought.</p>

<p>There is always in the mind of the literary man
some doubt how far one author has the moral
right thus to bejuggle the work of another, even
in translation. One who has written cannot help
being influenced by a sort of sub-consciousness of
what his own feelings would be if a translator
were to work such a transformation upon one of
his books. Letting this pass, however, it is to be
said that popular demands in regard to the quality
and veracity of translations have steadily advanced.
The paraphraser is now forced to appeal to a public
intellectually lower than that he formerly addressed.
The literary grade of the admirers of
Mrs. Wister&rsquo;s books is probably distinctly below
what it was ten years ago. Her school may be
said practically to have had its day; and the translator
in the best sense has taken the place of the
paraphraser.</p>

<p>It is not that the translator may not take liberties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
as we have already seen in speaking of idiom.
It is that where before liberties were taken for the
pleasure or from the caprice of the paraphraser,
variations are now supposed to be made by the
translator for the sole purpose of imparting to the
reader a better idea of the impression produced by
the original on those who read it in its first form.
Miss Wormeley, for instance, is publishing a version
of the comedies of Molière. She has decided
that she can give the American reader who is unacquainted
with French a better idea of the plays
by rendering them into prose than by attempting
the rhymed verse of the original. To the
average American of to-day the effect is undoubtedly
more satisfactory than that of any metrical
version could be. This is an extreme instance,
and it involves the difficulty of retaining the beauties
and value of poetical forms in translation, but
it illustrates the length to which variations from
the original may legitimately go if they are made
in the line of fidelity to the impression of the
original.</p>

<p>The two great principles in translation, then,
are faithfulness to the impression produced by the
work in its own language, and faithfulness to the
tongue into which it is rendered, especially in idiomatic
constructions. It is to be remembered that
the difficulty of producing a satisfactory version
is never an excuse for any failure. The fact that
one undertakes to make a translation is equivalent
to a profession of ability to cope with whatever obstacles
the task may present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>The value of translating as a help toward literary
facility is a thing which should not be overlooked
by the student. Whatever increases ease
in the handling of language is of worth, and especially
valuable is whatever forces the writer to
greater exactness in the use of words and phrases.
Reading aloud in English from a book in another
language is excellent practice in the line of training
the mind to quickness in the use of words;
and this is especially good for one going into newspaper
work.</p>

<p>It is going a little out of our way to comment
here on the translation which comes into school
work, but a word may not be amiss. It is always
to be remembered, both by teacher and by pupil,
that translation involves two languages, and one as
fully as the other. Too often work of this sort
is done as if the foreign language was the one to
be considered exclusively. Students are allowed
to give an approximate meaning of the Latin or
the French which they are reading, putting their
so-called translation into a verbal jargon which
uses the English vocabulary, but which is no
more English than the dictionary becomes a poem
from having in it the words used in poetry. This
is unfair to the student in several ways. It makes
him hate what he is doing; it prevents his ever
having anything like a proper or true idea of the
value of the literature which he is mangling out
of a foreign tongue into mongrel English. It
destroys his feeling for his own language, and it
makes it all but impossible for him to be taught
English composition. More than one teacher who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
agonizes in spirit over the themes of his or her
pupils, wondering why it is seemingly so impossible
to teach them to write even reasonably well,
might find an answer to the perplexing question
by considering the English into which they are
allowed to render their work in the languages. If
pupils are let to translate from French and German
and Latin into a sort of schoolroom dialect,
inexact, unidiomatic, and lifeless, it is gross stupidity
to expect that they will fail to be influenced
by this. A pupil&rsquo;s education is a unit. As long
as it is assumed that his training in the languages
is one thing, in mathematics another, and in geography
or history a third, there is a constant loss of
energy in counteracting the effects of this mistake.
Every branch must be taught with a view to every
other, and learned with a view to every other; and
especially evident is it that in all teaching the matter
of the proper use of the language of the learner
should be kept always in sight. The translation
which injures the pupil&rsquo;s use of his own tongue
does him a harm which cannot be atoned for by
any knowledge it gives him of another.</p>

<p>It must by this time be apparent that translation
in the best sense is really so closely allied to
original work as hardly to be distinguished from
it. In fact no writer can hope to produce successful
versions of works of imagination who has not
himself a genuine literary gift, carefully trained.
The pathetic idea of so many young women that
because they have taken lessons in French and
German they can make their living by translating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
from those languages is quickly and painfully
crushed by any attempt to carry it into practice;
but there is far from being any adequate conception
even among general writers of how difficult
an art really good translation is. Yet so rapidly
is public taste being educated in this matter that
poor versions from other tongues become every day
more and more futile and ineffective.</p>

<p class="captitle">CRITICISM</p>

<p>Criticism is the estimation of work by defined
standards. In its application to literature it is the
trying of whatever is written. It is, so to say, the
balance-sheet of composition.</p>

<p>Criticism is a sort of Exposition, yet it is well to
consider it by itself because it has so much the nature
of a general survey of the whole field of composition.
Indeed, since literary training depends
so largely upon self-criticism, it is essential to understand
its methods and principles before one can
hope to progress fast or far.</p>

<p>There has never before been a time when there
has been so much talk about the art as in the latter
half of this century, and seldom a time when there
has been less of the genuine article. Matthew
Arnold preached the gospel of criticism, and the
world went on its uncritical way very much as before.
There have even been doubts expressed
whether there was after all any such thing save in
theory. That entertaining Philistine, Mr. Andrew
Lang, has declared that criticism is nothing but the
expression of personal opinion, and has strengthened
his position by pretty consistently living up
to the assertion. The definition has been somewhat
widely accepted; and it is certainly true that much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
which in common speech is called criticism is nothing
more or less than an expression of prejudice
or opinion. Indeed, in common speech the word is
pretty generally used to signify mere fault-finding.
There is, however, no more propriety in using the
verb &ldquo;to criticise&rdquo; in the sense of &ldquo;to censure&rdquo;
than in the sense of &ldquo;to praise.&rdquo; It means neither.
Its nearest synonym is &ldquo;to estimate,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;to measure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Criticism is appreciation based upon comparison
of work with defined standards. To criticise is to
form or to express an opinion. It is as far from
blame on the one hand as from praise on the
other; but it establishes the reason for either.
As a branch of Exposition it is a written estimate.
The principles of the art are the same whatever
is the nature of the work to which judgment is
applied, but we shall speak of it here chiefly as
applied to literature.</p>

<p>The first necessity in criticism is that of a standard.
Without definite standards there can be no
measurement of work. There is no estimating the
truth or falsity of anything unless there is first
some idea of truth; the merit or the worthlessness
of a thing cannot be measured unless there be some
ideal by which it may be judged. Until one has
personal standards by which to measure life he
cannot be said to have any moral identity; until
he has standards by which to estimate ideas, he has
no intellectual identity; until he has definite and
defined standards by which to criticise literature it
is hardly possible to consider that he has literary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
identity or that he is entitled to lay claim to any
literary opinion as his own.</p>
<p>I have spoken in a former lecture of that irritating
class who take refuge behind the phrase, &ldquo;I do
not know what is good or bad, but I know what I
like.&rdquo; The phrase is a confession of either mental incapacity
or of mental slothfulness. It means either
&ldquo;I am too stupid to think out the reason why this
pleases me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am too lazy to think.&rdquo; It is
a moral duty for one to know why one likes or dislikes
a thing. I do not mean that we can go to
the ultimate analysis of the reasons why beauty
delights and ugliness pains. I do mean that the
possession of reason lays on a man a moral obligation
to use it; and that so far as his individual
reason can go, it is his duty to examine the grounds
of his feelings. How is a man to have the courage
of his dislikes if he does not know upon what they
rest? It is the duty of every rational creature to
have opinions. In order to have opinions it is necessary
to estimate belief and feeling. In order to
estimate it is needful to have standards.</p>

<p>All this being so, how are standards to be obtained?
There is unfortunately no market where
they are to be bought; and the mere mention of
acquiring them fills untrained and timorous minds
with a shuddering sense of horribly laborious undertaking.
Yet in its plainest form the matter is
simply to know what one believes; and that is the
first step in any mental development which can
claim to be genuine. This does not mean that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
criticism is to be a matter of personal opinion in
the sense of its being arbitrary liking or disliking.
It means that the first standard by which all work
must be tried is that of its truth; and that to be
able to measure its truth it is necessary to know
what one regards as truth. To be able to estimate
the verity of a book it is essential that one have
definite opinions in regard to the truth as it concerns
life and humanity, and that one be not in the
least in doubt what those opinions are. Criticism
by vague opinions is like weight by an uncertain
balance.</p>

<p>For individual criticism, moreover, it is absolutely
essential that judgment be made by truth as
it appears to the critic, and not by his idea of what
others may think to be truth. His knowledge of
what others believe is to influence him in establishing
a standard, not in his measurement of works
by it. In other words, we all are and should be
affected in our decision of what is truth by the
opinion of our fellow-men. When we have made
up our mind that a certain thing is true, we try
work by it as a standard without reference to the
belief or the disbelief of others.</p>

<p>This is a matter which reaches far. It seems to
me that it is hardly possible to insist too strongly
in education upon the need of realizing one&rsquo;s opinions.
What many persons call their mind is
merely a sort of mental protoplasm from which a
mind may with care be developed, and the most
effective means of development is that of defining
clearly the things which we believe and of assuring
ourselves as exactly as may be what to us is and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
what is not truth.</p>

<p>Our idea of truth is the standard by which we
estimate the thing that a work expresses, whether
in idea or in impression. To estimate the mechanics
of a book, its technical finish, and all that has
to do with workmanship, it is necessary to study
the masterpieces of literature. To judge of what
may be done and what may therefore be fairly demanded,
it is necessary to examine those works
which have stood the test of time and which are
pronounced good by the verdict of mankind. It is
difficult to form our standards from contemporary
writings because in them what is permanent is apt
to be obscured by the temporary. Literature shows
the relation of men to their time and the relation
of man to life. In the classics of all languages, in
the books which have lived from generation to
generation, the temporary drops out of sight while
the essential remains. A story which showed the
relation of the men of the Restoration to the great
struggle between Puritanism and Royalty was of
poignant and even bitter interest to the readers of
that time because each reader was a partisan on
one side or on the other. To-day we have no personal
feeling in regard to these political and religious
differences, which without the aid of foot-notes
we very likely do not even understand. Only the
essential and human remains. We read such a
tale with a perception only of the revelation which
it makes of the nature of permanent human emotions.
We get from it only the truths which have
to do with the relation of man to life, not as it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
for one party or sect, but as it is for man as a
human being. When &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin&rdquo; was
new, it was hardly possible to look at it from a literary
standpoint, because from one side or the
other of the great anti-slavery question its readers
felt passionately its moral purpose. We are already
far enough away from the anti-slavery struggle
to be able to examine the book critically, and
to decide upon its literary qualities without reference
to its political or moral weight. It is only
when time has practically eliminated the temporary
and accidental in a work that we are able to look
at it in a temper dispassionate enough to allow us
to get from it an idea of the essential qualities
which shall be to us a standard.</p>

<p>The things which we are thus to learn from the
study of the masterpieces and the classics of literature,
are: first, the laws of province, and second,
the possibilities of literary expression. By the
laws of province&mdash;which is a somewhat formidable
name for a not very complicated thing&mdash;I mean
what is the province of each variety of literary
form. This would include, for instance, the consideration
of the consistency of fairy tales, the discussion
of a moral purpose in fiction, methods in
writing history or biography, and all the many
matters of this nature. If we are to consider how
well a novelist has done his work, it is necessary
that we have some clearly defined notion of what
comes properly within the scope of a novel; if we
are to criticise a romance, a history, an essay, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
in any case needful that we be acquainted with
what the experience of permanent literature and
the judgment of the masters have decided to be the
proper range of each sort of writing. This is what
is meant by the laws of province. It is only by
the careful study of the best works of these several
sorts that we become qualified to judge how far
a new production holds by the laws which should
govern a composition of its kind. This is the more
difficult as these laws are largely unwritten, and
from the nature of things must be differently applied
in different cases.</p>

<p>One thing must be said in regard to the authority
of the classics, the masterpieces of literature to
which we are to go to learn our standards. The
young author is apt to feel that it is a mark of
weakness to confess that he is influenced by the
example of those who have gone before him. He
protests, often pretty vigorously, against this autocratic
rule of authors long since dust strewn as far
as waters flow or the wind speeds. He feels that
it is for the living to make laws for the living, and
this generally means in his own case a willingness
to make such canons, or at least a determination to
be a law unto himself. The difficulty is that he
does not recognize the true state of things. The
domain of literature is not a despotism, but the
most absolutely free of all republics. No author,
no matter how great he be, can force the public to
accept his book or can impose his works upon the
generations. It is by the suffrages of the readers
of the world that he stands or falls, and if there was
ever given in the whole world a disinterested and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
impartial vote, it is precisely this decision which
the world makes upon the merit of works. What
we call the classics are the books which the world
has decided are good. It is the consensus of the
opinion of mankind that dominates here. The
opinion of individuals is often wrong. I doubt if
the verdict of generations upon a book ever errs
substantially.</p>

<p>Yet another thought is of importance. To write
is to endeavor to communicate thought. It is manifestly
inconsistent and illogical not to choose that
method of communication to which the world will
listen. The measure of the world&rsquo;s willingness is
to be found in the works which the world has permanently
approved. We learn our standards from
the masterpieces of literature, we say; we might
say: Here are the books which show what form of
composition will be attended to by the world which
the writer wishes to address. To see how far
successful a given author has been in doing what
he attempted, it is well to compare his work with
this.</p>

<p>The forming of standards of mechanical excellence
is of course founded on the same principles
as those by which we determine what I have called
the laws of province. There is no hard-and-fast
rule by which to define exactly the limits of one
department of literature or another, and the only
thing which can without qualification be said is
that no one can write criticisms which are of any
lasting or indeed of any transient value who is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
well acquainted with the great body of good English
literature.</p>
<p>One thing should be kept constantly in mind in
writing criticisms, and that is that the critic must
appreciate and hold to the point of view of the
author criticised. The great point is to know what
the author tried to do, and to judge how far he has
succeeded in doing it. If a book is written for
the general public, for instance, it is manifestly unfair
to complain that it does not meet the needs of
the specialists; and equally would it be unfair to
find fault with the volume carefully prepared for
the specialist for not being adapted to the average
reader. Be sure that in writing a criticism you
are clear in regard to what it is proper to expect
from a given book, and in regard also to what the
work is or is not as judged by the standard thus
established. Criticism must first of all things be
definite.</p>

<p>One of the powers first to be called into play in
forming an estimate of any work is that of analysis.
It is impossible to compare the qualities of a
composition with the standard in our mind, without
separating those qualities from each other. We
must be able to say that this passage has Force,
that that has Elegance; to see that the work as a
whole possesses Force but lacks Clearness; and so
on for any and all the characteristics which may
be found. It is necessary to study the effect which
a work produces, and again to be able to tell upon
what means those effects depend. In no other way
can we put ourselves in a position to estimate fairly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
and conclusively the value and the lasting merit of
that which we criticise.</p>

<p>I have more than once reminded you that literary
work that is worth the name is a severe labor.
It has never seemed to me worth while to attempt
to lure you on with delusive persuasions of easy
roads to literary perfection. All literary work
which is worth doing is laborious and long; and
of all literature which is generally included under
the head of belles-lettres it seems to me that criticism
is intellectually the most severe. It is so
largely a matter of pure intellect that it even
seems more arduous than it is. In writing poetry
or fiction, or indeed any purely creative work, the
pleasure of creation arouses the emotions and kindles
the fancy. One can now and then give the
rein to his mind, so to say, and let the steeds of
his imagination start off for a dash. In criticism
the imagination has no office save that of being
sympathetic and of entering into the mood of another.
The strain on the attention and the judgment
is constant; and that there are no more good
critics is to be accounted for by the explanation&mdash;which
is almost an excuse&mdash;that criticism is so
difficult an art.</p>

<p>When all other qualifications for criticising have
been considered, there remains that most elusive,
most essential of all,&mdash;taste. Taste is a fine sense
of the fitness of things; a perception of the proper
proportion in work, and of the limits to which the
expression of feeling or emotion can go. It is
closely allied to a sense of humor in its quality.
It is no less a delicate appreciation of the fitness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
means to effect, and of the propriety of the ways
by which an author has endeavored to impress his
readers. Taste is the self-respect of the imagination.
It determines the line beyond which the
fancy cannot go with dignity.</p>

<p>It is that faculty by which we decide that one
shade of incongruity is humorous and touching,
yet that the shade but a trifle deeper is vulgar and
repulsive. The knowledge how far things should
be carried; sensitiveness to literary propriety;
delicacy to finest differences of effect, are all dependent
upon this faculty, which underlies all æsthetic
perception. How to improve it, refine it,
develop it, is the question of all culture. Goethe
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Taste should be educated by contemplation, not of
the tolerably good, but of the truly excellent&hellip;.
The best &hellip; when you have fully apprehended,
&hellip; you will have a standard, and will know how to
value inferior performances without overrating them.&mdash;<i>Conversations.</i>
</p></div>

<p>There is little that can be added to this. The
best books well read will do all for the taste that
definite outward cultivation can do. The rest is a
matter of inner growth. No one is fitted to criticise
work until he has learned to appreciate work. Even
a felon may claim to be tried by his peers, and
surely an author is fairly entitled to at least this
grace. The peer of an author in this sense is the
man who sympathetically is able to understand
him; who is trained to perceive what is the aim of
a book, and so is in a position to judge how far it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
has succeeded or failed. Until one is conscious of
having attained to this he should at least be modest
in his judgments; he should define his opinions
for himself, but he will not claim that infallibility
which belongs only to the critic of the highest rank
and which is claimed only by those of the lowest.</p>

<p>All this has to do with criticism as it should be,
and as it is at its best. This is what men like
Sainte-Beuve, Leslie Stephen, Taine, Lowell, and
those of their rank have made it. If the question
is that of writing what are called criticisms for the
press, and especially for the daily press, the matter
is not entirely the same. A newspaper is a business
enterprise. The publishers have not established it
in the interest of abstract virtues, and they generally
care neither more nor less for ideals, whether
literary or otherwise, than the broker or the banker
next door. They conduct their business very much
as business which depends directly upon public
support is conducted everywhere. They endeavor
to learn what the largest number of buyers will
like, and this they endeavor to supply. If too
many newspapers of to-day are nothing more or
less than mental dram-shops or bagnios, the men
who have not too much principle or self-respect to
keep them have at least the defense, such as it is,
that they print what the public proves itself most
eager to buy.</p>

<p>The general public is neither willing nor able to
enjoy genuine criticism, and the publishers do not
give it to them. Criticism as it is to-day practiced
as a matter of literary work, is apt to mean the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
writing of perfunctory book-reviews, notices of plays
and concerts and pictures, all to entertain the
reader or to provoke him to buy. There are a
great many persons, moreover, who either have no
time to read, or no mind to read the books of the
day, yet who wish to appear to have opinions in
regard to them. It is for this class that the great
bulk of book-reviews are written. The publisher
of a newspaper is aware that by furnishing what
will with the unthinking pass for opinions he can
on the one hand please unintelligent subscribers
and on the other gratify the book publishers from
whom come advertisements. There are very many
reviewers who are too honest to say a thing which
they do not believe, yet who are aware that if they
said all that they think they would not be able to
hold their places for a day. I do not wish to be
unjust to the newspapers. I am too lately out of
an editorial chair myself to be in a position to reflect
upon them too hardly. I must say, however,
that it is the aim of every newspaper to please the
publishers if it is possible, and that there are not
half a dozen in the country&mdash;if there are any&mdash;which
are not in their reviews influenced by other
considerations besides the merit of the works noticed.
I should as soon think of taking my political
opinions from a paid stump-speaker as my
literary judgments from the book-reviews in a
newspaper. The intellectual furnishing of a mind
which is guided by them is like the plenishings of
a room supplied with second-hand furniture purchased
on the installment plan and decorated with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
cigarette-advertising lithographs.</p>

<p>In its high and proper sense, however, criticism
is not alone a matter of literature, but of life as
well. Culture is mainly a matter of self-criticism.
We do not really know unless we are fully aware
what we know. In other words, the distinction
between conscious knowledge and vague impression
is the measure of development. The correctness
of self-estimate marks the difference between the
cultivated and the uncultivated mind. It might on
first thought seem as if this confounded culture
with self-consciousness. On the contrary it distinguishes
it from that painful weakness. Self-consciousness
arises from a doubt of the mind; an
inability to tell what is one&rsquo;s true value and one&rsquo;s
true place. Culture is a fair and reasonable appreciation
at once of one&rsquo;s mental merits and shortcomings;
a knowledge of one&rsquo;s intellectual rank.
This fairness of estimate enables the possessor of
this quality to take his intellectual place without
false shame on the one hand or false pride on the
other; two faults which are the warp and woof of
self-consciousness. Education is not acquisition,
but assimilation; and assimilation is impossible
without that mental judgment which is the best
and final form of criticism. Mental advancement
is possible only by the establishment in the mind
of well-defined standards, and the measuring by
them of the thoughts, the ideas, the opinions; and
to establish definite standards and to measure by
them is criticism, the tonic of the mind.</p>

<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII">XXII</a></h2>

<p class="captitle">STYLE</p>

<p>The question which these talks set out to consider
was what one can do to learn to write well. I
began by saying that there are two sorts of power
which enter into literary production, the communicable
and the incommunicable, that which may be
taught and that which is inborn, the technical and
the imaginative. Naturally we have discussed
chiefly the power which may be learned, those details
of structure and of quality which depend
upon means which we are able to analyze. The
subject of which I wish now to say a little is connected
rather with those powers and qualities which
can be directly neither acquired nor imparted.
We cannot close without some consideration of
Style, that thing most elusive and intangible in
its elements, yet most definite and recognizable in
its effects; and Style in its more exact sense is a
matter which has to do less with the mechanics of
literature than with the creative impulse of the
mind. Regarded in its higher aspect it is closely
linked with the imagination, that faculty which, if
the figure were not too mathematical, one might
call reason raised to the <i class="cor">n</i>th power.</p>

<p>The term style is commonly used rather indefinitely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
to indicate either technical finish or the more
subtle qualities of literary expression. Of course as
far as it is to be understood in the former sense, we
have been discussing it from the very beginning of
these talks. If we understand it to mean merely
correctness or even elegance of language, the proper
proportion of the different parts of a composition,
the accurate choice of words and the judicious employment
of figures and of ornaments, we may be
said to have dealt with all this in the previous
lectures.</p>

<p>If I were to attempt to sum up concisely the
more important points of what I have said, hitherto,
it would be possible to cover a large portion of the
ground by saying that the secret of literary ease
and finish lies in attention to details. In my youth
and in the dame-school in which I began to learn
to write it was the fashion to set down moral and
improving sentiments in the copy-books, and one of
them was the sententious maxim with which you
are all familiar,&mdash;&ldquo;Trifles make up perfection,
but perfection is no trifle.&rdquo; The hackneyed saying
is a good deal nearer to being exact than are
most didactic aphorisms. It is certainly true that
though perfection is above all trifles yet a trifle
may spoil it. The slightest touch breaks a bubble,
and a single bad epithet will spoil a passage otherwise
effective. To neglect details is to neglect the
whole.</p>

<p>It is true that to consider only details is to deprive
the work of all unity. It is like finishing
carefully all the pieces which are to be set in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
mosaic and neglecting to consider the design of the
whole. I need not repeat here what has been said
of the need of dealing with any literary work as
a unit; but it is necessary to keep this in mind.
Conceive a thing as broadly as possible. Look at
it in the large; see it as clearly as you are able in
its general outlines; and make it the aim of your
labor to embody in words this broad conception
firmly and clearly. When this is accomplished go
over your work with a microscope to discover if
there be anything in it which will prevent or injure
the effect. Indeed, if you hope to be finished
artists in words, it will be necessary that you see
to it that every detail not only does not lessen the
effect of the whole, but that it is a positive advantage
and addition. It is only by such care in the
management of trifling particulars that the finest
results are to be obtained.</p>

<p>Going beyond all these largely mechanical matters,
we come to the consideration of a more intangible,
and yet a higher thing.</p>

<p>Suppose that you came upon these three passages
in some book which did not give their authorship.
Could you, although you had never seen them before,
suppose that they had been written by the
same author?&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Of this thing, however, be certain: wouldst thou
plant for Eternity, then plant into the deep infinite
faculties of man, his Fantasy and Heart; wouldst
thou plant for a Year and Day, then plant into his
shallow superficial faculties, his Self-love and Arithmetical
Understanding, what will grow there. A
Hierarch, therefore, and Pontiff of the World-will we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
called him, the Poet and inspired Maker; who, Prometheus-like,
can shape new Symbols, and bring new
Fire from Heaven to fix it there.&mdash;<i>Sartor Resartus</i>,
iii. 3.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>The figure of that first ancestor, invested by family
tradition with a dim and dusky grandeur, was present
to my boyish imagination, as far back as I can remember.
It still haunts me, and induces a sort of home-feeling
with the past, which I scarcely claim in reference
to the present phase of the town. I seem to
have a stronger claim as a resident here on account of
this grave, bearded, sable-cloaked and steeple-crowned
progenitor,&mdash;who came so early, with his Bible and
his sword, and trode the unworn street with such a
stately port, and made so large a figure, as a man of
war and peace,&mdash;a stronger claim than for myself,
whose name is seldom heard and my face hardly
known.&mdash;<i>The Custom House.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>An obese person, with his waistcoat in closer connection
with his legs than is quite reconcilable with
the established ideas of grace, with that cast of feature
which is figuratively called a bottle-nose, and with a
face covered all over with pimples. He had been a tender
plant once upon a time, but, from constant blowing
in the fat air of funerals, had run to seed.&mdash;<i>Martin
Chuzzlewit.</i></p></div>

<p>Whether the reader recognized in these passages
the hand of Carlyle, of Hawthorne, and of Dickens
would of course depend upon his experience; but
if he had any susceptibility to literary expression,
he would appreciate the fact that they are somehow
different. He would feel the distinction which
arises from those essential qualities, both of matter
and of manner, which distinguish one piece of
literature from every other composition whatever.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
To the sum of these qualities we give the name
Style. Style in this sense is the individuality of
a work. What personality is to a human being,
that is style to a composition. Indeed, one would
be doing no great violence to language who defined
this quality as the &ldquo;personal equation&rdquo; of a
work.</p>

<p>Style is the personal impress which a writer inevitably
sets upon his production. It is that character
in what is written which results from the
fact that these thoughts and emotions have been
those of the author rather than of any other human
being. It is the expression of one man&rsquo;s individuality,
as sure and as unique as the sound of his
voice, the look from his eye, or the imprint of his
thumb. It is the quality which gives to the work
of a master-mind, a mind in which the intellectual
individuality is well developed, a flavor so unique
that no man familiar with literary effects can mistake
it for that of any other. It is style in this
sense which is proof of authorship so conclusive that
if we had authenticated and solemnly sworn declarations
from both Shakespeare and Bacon that
the latter wrote the plays attributed to the former,
we should still know beyond all peradventure that
this could not be. The final appeal in a case of
doubt of authorship is the internal evidence. I
do not mean to assert that mistakes may not arise
here as in all other human affairs; but I do mean
that it is inconceivable that any great imaginative
work should be produced which should fail of
bearing in it the incontestable mark of its author&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
personality. We say that one writer imitates another&rsquo;s
style so cleverly that it is not possible for
the counterfeit to be distinguished from the real.
This may sometimes be true of the trifles of literature,
though I doubt if even here the genuine
expert could not detect the imposition. In those
writings in which a genius has expressed his inner
being, in which his imagination has unveiled itself,
in which that true self that dwells in every human
creature and with which we sometimes feel that we
are hardly acquainted in our own case,&mdash;in these
it is impossible that the stamp of his personality
should not be impressed upon the work. It follows
in the case mentioned that one thing of which
a literary man is pretty likely to be sure is that
whoever wrote the plays attributed to William
Shakespeare, it is outside the limits of conceivable
literary or human possibilities that they were written
by the author of the poems and essays avowedly
the work of Francis Bacon. There are those who
would deny the truth of this illustration, I believe,
but there is nobody who denies that an imaginative
writer stamps the character of his mind upon his
productions.</p>

<p>This matter of individualism is one of the most
elusive and yet one of the most tangibly persuasive
of all matters connected with literary art. Suppose
two authors to be equally correct, equally well
informed, well trained, and to write upon subjects
in which we are equally interested. It will still
be true that one will please us more than the other.
There will be a certain quality, an almost intangible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
flavor about one book which is lacking in
the other. One author will maintain a dignity in
his attitude toward his subject, or he will possess
a persuasive manner; in one way or another his
individuality will charm us. We say that we are
pleased with his style. We mean that the individual
quality of what he writes has attracted us. To
go back a little farther in analysis, what we say
means practically that in the nature of the mind
and the character of the author there is that which
appeals to us as human beings or to us in particular
as individuals. Here we touch upon an important
principle which underlies this whole matter.
The secret of charm in style lies in character.
You have all heard innumerable times the saying
that &ldquo;Style is the man.&rdquo; In other words, style as
a matter of structure in composition is the indication
of what a man can do; style as a matter of
quality is an indication of what he is.</p>

<p>The ways in which individuality shows itself
are numerous. Each writer, for instance, may be
said to make his own vocabulary. He consciously
increases his knowledge of words, deliberately
chooses certain terms for particular uses, and carefully
decides upon the especial term which in each
case seems to him best adapted to convey his meaning.
Besides this he unconsciously has a preference
toward this word or that, he is influenced by
association, by the suggestions which are aroused
in his mind by this synonym or that, and is in
every decision swayed in one direction or another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
by the fineness of his perceptions, the nature of his
temperament, and by all those minute and mingled
elements which make up what we know as character.
All these conscious and all these unconscious
causes help to bring it about that every
writer shall make for himself what Walter Pater
calls a &ldquo;vocabulary faithful to the coloring of his
own spirit;&rdquo; and the same principle may easily be
traced through all the divisions of the literary art,
whether they be of structure or of quality.</p>

<p>It follows that to talk of style in the higher
sense is to consider character in its broadest and
deepest extent. It is impossible to discuss any
question of human life to its farthest limits without
finding that it rests upon an ethical basis. The
best method of phrasing aspiration and passion in
art cannot be determined until we have searched
out the nature of passion and of aspiration; until
we have fixed upon some theory of man&rsquo;s relation
to life and truth, and this is what is meant by
ethics. If one examined far enough, it is probable
that it would appear that the same is true of things
which seem to us infinitely trivial. There is as
truly a moral reason why children making mud
pies in the gutter should not quarrel as there is
that Dante&rsquo;s &ldquo;Divine Comedy&rdquo; is an immortal
work. If we search deep enough, the reason why
the children are amused by their mud pies is as
surely to be found in the relations of human beings
to life as is the reason of the spiritual exaltation
which may come from the appreciative reading of
the poet. I said the other evening that it might
seem that I had a tendency to speak of English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
Composition as if it involved the whole duty of
man; we have now come to the place where it is
evident that it does. We cannot go into so extensive
an examination as the foundation of morals
and the elements of character, so that I shall content
myself with pointing this out, leaving each to
make&mdash;or not to make, as he pleases&mdash;such reflections
and such deductions as fit his own need and
his own inclinations.</p>

<p>It is strictly in the line of literary work, however,
to comment once more upon the use of books
in intellectual development as applied to style.
What a man reads affects what he writes indirectly
by its effect upon what he is, as we have before
seen that it has a direct and swift agency in shaping
his methods of expression. What the company he
keeps is to a man&rsquo;s character, this to his style are
the books he reads. A writer cannot accustom
himself to the pages of the masters of literature
and be content to write meanly and incorrectly.
He may not consciously contrast his work with
theirs, but the influence of their example is with
him always. In very trying circumstances, I once
said to a workman against whom falsehood seemed
to be proved, &ldquo;In spite of everything, I do believe
that you have been telling me the truth.&rdquo; He
answered me with a simplicity which was nothing
less than noble, &ldquo;If you knew my wife, sir, you&rsquo;d
know that I couldn&rsquo;t live with her and lie.&rdquo; I
learned afterward that this was the exact state of
the case. His wife was a rather silent woman, and
I do not believe that she had ever lectured her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
husband on truth-telling. It was simply that one
could not live in her influence and be willing to be
guilty of falsehood. In the same way one cannot
live familiarly with good literature and knowingly
write bad.</p>

<p>It is not that one imitates good authors. Any
imitation is bad art, because there should always
be in what is done the ring of genuine, personal
conviction. The imitator is not giving expression
to that within him which is so real and so strong
that it will not be suppressed. He is trying to
show that he can feel as some one else has felt,
that he can write as somebody else has written. It
is a sham, and the reader feels that it is a sham.
Imitation, moreover, is at best but a reproduction
of the more obvious peculiarities of work, while at
worst it is a catching of tricks, mannerisms, and
faults. It may be added, too, that it is oftener at
its worst than at its best. Anybody can imitate
the defects of a style, and few its virtues.</p>

<p>In these days nobody reads avowedly for style
directly. There was once an idea that it was well
to select an author of standing and deliberately
attempt to catch his manner, or, as the phrase went,
to &ldquo;form one&rsquo;s style on the master.&rdquo; The idea
was about as sensible as would be the notion that
it were well for a young man not wholly satisfied
with his features to &ldquo;form&rdquo; his nose after that
of the Apollo Belvedere. Style is the expression
of selfhood. No writer can embody his own individuality
in the expression of the individuality of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
another. Learn from the masterpieces what is
good use in diction, in construction, in arrangement;
learn from them to be strenuous, persuasive,
and sincere in whatever you do; but do not for a
moment think of obtaining from them that personal
flavor which can come only from the writer himself,
and which is the thing which makes style in its
highest sense.</p>

<p>It is the development of the personality of the
writer which saves a composition from becoming
mechanical. In the first of these talks I quoted
the instructions which Flaubert gave to Guy de
Maupassant, in which he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whatever may be the thing which one wishes to say,
there is but one word for expressing it; only one verb
to animate it, only one adjective to qualify it. It is
essential to search for this word, for this verb, for this
adjective, until they are discovered, and to be satisfied
with nothing else.</p></div>

<p>This I commended to you as sound and necessary
advice. From our present point of view, however,
it is to be seen that this is the attitude of a student
rather than that of an artist. In other words it is
rather the way to learn to write than the way to
write. So painfully minute a method as that which
Flaubert recommended to his pupil would bring
to an end all spontaneous or impassioned writing.
The mind should be trained by these severe and
careful methods until exactness of expression becomes
a second nature. Then for good or for bad
one must write as one is impelled to write at the
particular moment. In revision the most strict requirements
may be held to, so long as there is kept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
in mind the danger of revising the life out of imaginative
writing and of refining until spontaneity is
lost. Work should be revised with patient, with
inexhaustible care; but it must be revised delicately.
No formal correctness, no perfection of epithet
or propriety of diction, can atone for the sacrifice
of the intangible qualities which in the original
form express the mood of the writer, and are to
a composition what the personality is to a human
being.</p>

<p>In all the talks which preceded this we have
been considering work as that of the student who
is preparing to write rather than as that of the
author who is actually producing. When we talk
of style we are dealing with the production of literature.
The student who has not mastered details
in the most painfully minute manner has not fitted
himself for that perception of a subject on broad
lines which is the condition of successful production.
William Blake has said: &ldquo;In order to know
what is enough, it is necessary to know what is
more than enough.&rdquo; The student must have acquired
thoroughly the highest degree of elaboration
possible in order that he may be able to judge
what is proper and effective in any given case.
He cannot fairly judge how far it is safe to go,
unless he is keenly aware of what it is to go too
far.</p>

<p>In considering a literary work as a whole and in
treating it as an expression of his own particular
and peculiar individuality, it is well for a writer
to bear in mind a phrase of Mr. George Saintsbury,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
the English critic. &ldquo;The first rule of literature,&rdquo;
he says, &ldquo;is that what is presented shall be
presented not merely as it is, but transformed, and,
if I may say so, <i>dis</i>realized.&rdquo; This is easily and
obviously true of fiction. It is manifestly impossible
to give a realized picture of life as it actually
exists, to tell everything which must have happened
to characters, how they eat and sleep, shiver when
getting into their baths in the morning, find their
egg too much or too little cooked at breakfast, get
out of breath in hurrying to catch a street-car, and
all the rest of the innumerable trifles which make
up the bulk of life. On this plan the simplest
story would be expanded into as many volumes as
&ldquo;Clarissa Harlowe.&rdquo; The same principle of selection
and departure from reality is no less true of
everything which is written. The thoughts which
a philosopher weaves into a profound system do
not come to him in sequence, beautifully arranged.
If he followed the actual order of nature, he would
put down a heterogeneous mass of reflections, good
and bad mingled together, with no system apparent
in them except after a painful study which no
reader would be at all likely to give to the confused
and confusing pages. Art is not nature. It
is not the reproduction of nature. It is the invention
of man to produce at will and to enshrine in
permanent form those impressions, those emotions
which come to him in rare and fleeting instants
when his own consciousness reaches for a quick
moment to the secret of that life which informs
nature. Remember that the object of writing is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
not to reproduce the actual; that it is not even
wholly that very different thing, to produce an impression
of the actual; it is to embody and to make
evident the truth which actualities express. Whoever
takes up his pen to produce literature undertakes
to make clearer the relation of man to nature
and to life. He sets out to say in all sincerity
what some fact of existence means to him. If he
is content to be a mere scribe, simply an artisan of
letters, he may deal with words in a mechanical
fashion, and manufacture composition as one makes
a deal table. This is honest work enough, but it
is not the production of literature. It is the work
of the hack-writer; of the reporter of life and not
of the interpreter of life. To produce literature
there must be an earnest attempt to embody the
writer&rsquo;s conception of some phase of existence.
There must be that expression of his convictions
and character which is what we mean when we use
the word style in its higher meaning.</p>

<p>It is of style in this sense that Goethe was thinking,
when he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>It is not language in itself and independently which
is accurate, vigorous, lucid, or graceful, but the spirit
which is embodied in it; and so it is not in the power
of every one to give to his work the good qualities
of expression that should belong to it. The question
is whether nature has given to the writer intellectual
and moral qualities which demand and shape out for
themselves such an embodiment [as he has given them]&mdash;intellectual
powers of intuition and penetration; and
not less moral power, that he may be able to resist the
evil demons who would hinder him in the unswerving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
loyalty that he must pay to truth.&mdash;Goethe: <i>Natur-Aphorismen</i>,
iv.</p></div>

<p>There is no better way of testing what one has
written than by comparing it with the work of
great writers. See wherein their work excels yours.
Do not thereupon say to yourself, &ldquo;Oh, of course
I am not to be expected to do as well as they.&rdquo;
Say rather: &ldquo;In so far as my work has fallen
short of the best that has been done, it has fallen
short of what has been shown to be possible. Let
me see how far I can bring it nearer to the standard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the second of his &ldquo;Discourses on Art,&rdquo; Sir
Joshua Reynolds says to his students of painting:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Comparing your own efforts with those of some
great master is indeed a severe and mortifying task,
to which none will submit but such as have great
views, with fortitude sufficient to forego the gratifications
of present vanity for future honor. When the
student has succeeded in some measure to his own satisfaction,
and has felicitated himself on his success, to
go voluntarily to a tribunal where he knows his vanity
must be humbled, and all self-approbation must vanish,
requires not only great resolution but great humility.
To him, however, who has the ambition to be a real
master, the solid satisfaction which proceeds from a
consciousness of his advancement (of which seeing his
own faults is the first step) will very abundantly compensate
for present disappointment.</p></div>

<p>This need not be said differently to apply to the
student of literature.</p>

<p>There is one thing of which he who desires to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
write literature may be sure, and that is that the
unpardonable sin in this as in all art is flippancy.
Flippancy is the prevailing literary vice of the age.
The periodicals are perhaps more largely to blame
for this than any other single cause, but newspapers
and magazines by no means have the whole
responsibility in this matter. The desire for amusement
has eaten us up. The overworked and nerve-shaken
public desires entertainment which shall
make no call on the intellect and as little as possible
on the perception. The man who could devise
the means of amusing his fellows without their being
obliged even to take the trouble to be aware of
it would almost be deified by this age. The modern
imagination is harder to awaken than the Sleeping
Beauty. An audience at the theatre to-day cannot
be persuaded to do anything for itself. In the days
of Shakespeare a placard on the stage transferred
all the beholders into the Forest of Arden or to the
enchanted isle of Prospero. To-day it is difficult
to induce the spectators to second the most elaborate
devices which have been contrived by scene-painter
and carpenter to assist their sluggish fancy.
There is even a large class apparently so completely
atrophied mentally as to be unable to follow a
simple plot on the stage. &ldquo;Variety shows&rdquo; to-day
take the place which real plays held once; short
stories with only so much substance as admits
of their being beaten up like the white of egg
on a custard are languidly read by the million;
and we have even replaced criticism by a sort of
shallow flippancy for which no other name seems
to me so appropriate as literary skirt-dancing. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
be clever in the most superficial sense of that word,
to be vulgarly glib, to reverence nothing, and above
all to be smart and amusing, seems to be the sum
and substance of the creed of writers who practice
this art. They substitute adroitness for depth,
scoffing for sentiment, and rapidity for brilliancy.
Their one aim is to entertain the idle mind, and to
win from astonishment the applause which they
have not the wit to gain from approbation. The
literary gymnastics of writers of these flippant
pseudo-criticisms are hardly more intellectual than
the supple evolutions of the ballet girl, and it is
to be doubted if the dance is not the more moral
and less debasing of the two.</p>

<p>This may sound extravagant, but when the influence
upon young readers and young writers is
considered it hardly seems possible to state the
matter too strongly. It is true that these writers
profess, so far as they profess anything, allegiance
to all the highest virtues, both moral and intellectual.
Their books are distinctly amusing&mdash;to
those whose taste is not offended by the tone of
flippancy which pervades them; and what they
write is often eminently clever. Their fault is
that they do not take life seriously; that they are
as devoid of reverence as a stone is of blood; that
their temper is as fatal to idealism, to enthusiasm,
to aspiration, as carbonic acid gas is to animal life.
Even the cynicism with which they are flavored is
as sham as is the tint of a glass ruby. For a
young writer to fall under this influence seems to
me as great a literary misfortune as it would be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
physical calamity for him to become crippled. If
one wishes to earn a trumpery wage by writing
smartly, these are his models; but if he is in love
with literature, he must turn his back. The young
writer should strive always to be serious before he
is smart, sincere before he is clever, and to flee
flippancy as he would flee the pestilence that stalketh
at noonday.</p>

<p>By serious, I do not necessarily mean grave, and
still less do I mean solemn. It is as true for the
writer of humorous literature that he should take his
art seriously as it is for the writer of history or of
sermons. No man ever took literature more seriously
than Charles Lamb, yet he remains one of the
most deliciously humorous writers of all time. He
was gay and whimsical and droll, but he never for
a moment failed of a high and noble respect for
literature; he was apparently freakish, but he did
not for a line become flippant. It would have been
impossible for him to be vulgar. His taste always
prevented his going too far. Even in the wildest
excesses of humorous literature it is still absolutely
needful to preserve a serious attitude toward literature
and toward life. It is not that this feeling
is to be obtruded. It is not meant that the jest
shall be made with the sour visage of a Puritan.
It is that the author himself shall never lose this
inner respect and reverence for the dignities of
life and for the truth. If these are a part of his
character he cannot write otherwise than with them
as it were forming a background to his work; and
no literature is of lasting value or even fame which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
lacks this.</p>

<p>One of the most striking examples of what I
mean is furnished by the poet François Villon,
thief, house-breaker, and scape-gallows. He believed
not in man, woman, or God, but he did hold
to faith in literary art. Life as a matter of every-day
existence he took flippantly enough, but literature
as an expression of life he still regarded
seriously,&mdash;and thus it happens that his poems
live to-day, and that they are part of permanent
literature.</p>

<p>Life is after all a serious matter to the lightest
human being. However it is embroidered over
with joys and jocund devices, with merriment or
frivolity, every man knows its solemnity. There
are for the most careless of men moments in which
the real gravity of his situation, as he stands insecurely
for a moment between the cradle and the
grave, forces itself upon him. The only universal
human experience is pain. To most men comes
hope, and to most comes love in some degree of
intensity. Joy, ambition, hate, and jealousy, are
common to perhaps the great majority of mankind,
and the writer who touches strongly and skillfully
upon any one of these is sure of appealing to most
readers. Only he who portrays sorrow and suffering
is dealing with an experience so universal that
he is sure that no man can fail of some appreciation
of the theme. Such being the case, it is only
the author who by his fundamental seriousness
implies&mdash;remotely, it may be, but surely&mdash;that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
he has a share in the universal heritage, who can
long or deeply command the attention of mankind.
To be flippant is to be inhuman; and although the
world may not analyze this, it is sure to feel it.
Style is the unconscious revelation of the writer&rsquo;s
attitude toward life, and if this be not serious all
good gifts and graces of technical skill and mental
cleverness, all adroitness of wit and strength of
intellectual perception, even all vividness of imagination,
will fail of making work great and permanently
effective.</p>

<p>Volumes might be written upon style and its relations
to authorship, but in the end it would still
be necessary to acknowledge that the finest essence
of literature is too subtle to be seized or analyzed.
The aim of these talks was to consider the practical
side of composition, and it is therefore aside
from the purpose to attempt to discuss further the
elusive æsthetic quality. Individual temperament
and individual purpose must in the end determine
what shall be the quality and style of all work;
so that the secrets of this branch of literary art
cannot be discovered until man is able to trace
the nature and the working of those twin halves
of the highest human consciousness, individuality
and imagination.</p>
